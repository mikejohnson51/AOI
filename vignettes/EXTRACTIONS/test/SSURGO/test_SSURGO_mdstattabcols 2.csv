The basis for identifying highly erodible land is the erodibility index of a soil survey map unit.  The erodibility index of a soil is determined by dividing the potential erodibility for each soil survey map unit by the soil loss tolerance (T) value established for the soil.  The potential erodibility for a map unit differs according to the erosion type (water or wind erosion).  The T value represents the maximum annual rate of soil erosion that could take place without causing a decline in long-term productivity.  A soil map unit with an erodibility index of 8 or more is a highly erodible soil map unit.

For water erosion, a soil survey map unit is potentially highly erodible if: (1) the RKLS/T value using the minimum LS factor is less than 8 and (2) the RKLS/T value using the maximum LS factor is equal to or greater than 8.
