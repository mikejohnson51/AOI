CO643,Fragile Soil Index,limitation,"Summary:

Soils can be rated based on their susceptibility to degradation in the ""Fragile Soil Index"" interpretation.  Fragile soils are those that are most vulnerable to degradation. They are easily degraded (have low resistance) and are highly susceptible to erosion with low resilience. They are characterized as having low organic matter contents, low water-stable aggregates and low soil structure. Fragile soils are generally located on sloping ground, have sparse plant cover, and tend to be in arid and semiarid regions. A fragile soil index interpretation was developed to rate soils based on their fragility. The index can be used in conservation and watershed planning to assist in identifying soils and areas with greater vulnerability to degradation.

Soils are placed into interpretive classes based on their index rating.  Interpretative classes are not fragile (index rating <= 0.009), slightly fragile (index rating > 0.009 and <= 0.209), moderately fragile (rating index > 0.209 and <= 0.409), fragile (rating index > 0.409 and <= 0.609), highly fragile (rating index > 0.609 and <= 0.809), or extremely fragile (rating index > 0.809 and <= 1.0).

Description:

Soil fragility defines how vulnerable a soil is to degradation processes. When used in soil survey the index assesses the inherent soil condition. Depending on a soils inherent characteristics and the climate, soils can vary from highly resistant, or stable, to those that are vulnerable and extremely sensitive to degradation. A soils fragility can change over time do to climate change and changes in site characteristics, and thus fragility will change. Under stress, fragile soils can degrade to a new altered state which may be less or unfavorable to plant growth and less capable of performing soil functions. To assess the fragility of the soil, vulnerability indicators to degradation processes (mostly erosion) are used. The minimum dataset of indicators of soil fragility are as follows:

Organic matter content - The greater the organic matter content, the less fragile the soil. The organic matter content indicates the capacity of the soil to resist and/or recover from degradation. Increases in organic matter can improve the soil pore structure, increase water infiltration, reduce soil compaction, and decrease runoff and soil erosion. Decreasing organic matter contents indicate there has been a reduction in the capacity of the soil to function.

Soil aggregation/structure characteristics - The greater the stability of aggregates or improvement in soil structure, the less fragile the soil. Aggregate stability/soil structure indicates the capacity of the soil to resist degradation from accelerated water erosion (by increasing the amount of infiltration). From a biological point of view it is the pore structure that is important because that is where life finds its habitat (Wall, 2005). Decreasing stability of aggregates and destruction of soil structure implies an increase in soil degradation.

Rooting/soil depth - The greater the rooting depth, the less fragile the soil. Shallow soils are more vulnerable to degradation because they have limited rooting depth and have a reduced capacity to generate new soil. Soil depth is important for productivity. As erosion removes the upper soil profile, productivity will decline if the subsoil is limiting for crop growth. If erosion processes continue, there will eventually be no soil.

Vegetation coverage - The greater the vegetation coverage, the less fragile the soil. Vegetation cover is the areal percentage of the soil surface that is covered with vegetation. It is the proportion of the soil surface that is obscured by above ground vegetation such as leaves, stems, and flowers. Uncovered soil is vulnerable to the processes of soil erosion, both by wind, water and gravity. Under a protective cover of vegetation, erosion goes on so slowly that it is seldom harmful and is associated with the natural environment (Bennett, 1951). 

Slope - The greater the slope, the more vulnerable the soil is to degradation (primarily from erosion). Slope is a measure of the steepness or the degree of inclination of a feature relative to the horizontal plane. The steeper the slope, the faster the runoff flow and the more force it will have to erode soil material.

Aridity - The greater the aridity, the more vulnerable the soil is to degradation (primarily from erosion). Aridity is defined by the shortage of moisture and is essentially a climatic phenomenon that is based on average climatic conditions over an area (Agnew and Anderson, 1992). Lack of water is a main factor limiting biological processes, and thus the capacity to recover from a disturbance (decreasing resilience with decreasing moisture). Land areas will differ in their susceptibility to degradation depending in part on their climate (Eswaran et al., 2001).

Fragile Soil Index

Response or scoring curves (Karlen and Stott, 1994) are developed for each indicator. Scoring curves standardize the relationship between an indicator and the vulnerability to degradation. They convert measured indicator data to relative values ranging from 0 to 1. The standardized scores are then weighted. Aridity is given three times the weight because of its importance. Without adequate water, soil health and vegetation are difficult to restore and biological processes cannot function. Vegetative cover is equally as important as slope with twice the weight. Without vegetative cover the soil is exposed to wind and rain energy and combined with steep slopes can be devastating (Pimentel, 2006). The weighted scores are then added together to form the Fragile Soil Index (FSI): 

FSI = (0.1 x OM) + (0.1 x AgS) + (0.1 x RD) + (0.2 x V) + (0.2 x S) + (0.3 x AI)

Where OM = organic matter content score, AgS = aggregate stability/soil structure score, RD = rooting depth score, V = vegetative cover score, S = slope score and AI = aridity index score. Index values range from 0 to 1 with one being the most fragile (or limiting). Interpretation ratings are produced for mapunit components and are generally aggregated to the mapunit. If organic matter, vegetative cover, slope, soil structure, or aridity index is not available (null), the mapunit component is not rated. Interpretation ratings (from 0 -1) and fragility classes are shown below:

Scope: National


Criteria:

1. Organic Matter: The organic matter content of the surface horizon (""A"" or ""O"" horizons) is used in the index.

Property used: ORGANIC MATTER IS SURFACE LAYER (Modality - representative value)

The scoring curve for soil organic matter content in the surface layer (""A"" or ""O"" horizon) is based on the curve developed by the Cornell soil health assessment (medium curve). This was chosen because of the high inherent organic matter contents of the northeast (based on climate and soils), and would provide the maximum potential for organic matter and soil health on agricultural soils (of that found within the US). The organic matter content ranges from 0 to 7% with a score of one as the most limiting with zero percent organic matter. Anything over 7% gets a score of zero. The scoring curve shape is sigmoid as follows:

          Organic Matter score = (a + cx + ex2)/(1 + bx + dx2 +fx3)
          a = 1.0002993; b = -0.14767395; c = -0.21024973; d = -0.0081101367; e = 0.009697; f = 0.0073572721; x = organic matter (%)

Organic matter (OM) limits:
          Extremely Low OM: < 1.3%
          Very Low OM: 1.3 to 2.6%
          Low OM: 2.6 to 3.9%
          Moderate OM: 3.9 to 5.2%
          High OM: 5.2 to 7.0%
          Very High OM: > 7%

Null organic matter is assigned a ""not rated"" for the interpretation.

2. Surface Structure: Soil structure of the surface layer is used in the index.

Property used: STRUCTURE INDEX OF SURFACE (Modality - representative value)

The scoring curve is based on the structure classes developed by Bob Grossman. The type, grade and size of structural units are grouped into classes as defined in Table 3 of the morphology index (Seybold et al., 2004). Structure classes range from 1 to 5 with 5 being the best.

Structure                          Criteria
  Class	
    5          Strong granular, strong very fine through medium blocky and very fine prismatic; 
                surface ""O"" horizons (structure is not applicable to organic layers); if soil structure is
                null and OM > 10%
    4          Moderate granular, moderate very fine and fine blocky; strong fine.
    3          Moderate medium blocky; very fine, fine and medium prismatic; strong very coarse
                and coarse blocky.
    2          Weak granular; moderate very coarse and coarse blocky; coarse and medium prismatic; 
                strong very coarse and coarse prismatic; weak platy; weak lenticular.
    1          All other soil structures (includes columnar, wedge, cloddy, massive, and single grain).
 
Scores are as follows:

	Structure Class score= 1 if structure class 1; 0.75 if structure class 2; 0.5 if structure class 3; 0.25 if structure class 4; 0 if structure class 5

Surface Structure limits:
          Poor structure: structure class = 1
          Weakly structured: structure class = 2
          Moderately structured: structure class = 3
          Well structured: structure class = 4
          Highly structure: structure class = 5
 
O horizons (and OM > 10 if structure is null) are assigned to the highly structured class.
Null surface structure is assigned a ""not rated"" for the interpretation.

3. Rooting Depth: Depth of the soil (or 152 cm) or to a root restrictive layer, whichever is shallower is used in the index. 

Property used: DEPTH TO FIRST RESTRICTION OR 152cm (Modality - representative value)

The scoring curve for effective rooting depth is developed based a maximum depth of 152 cm as being the least vulnerable to soil erosion. Response of crop yield to erosion is generally convex (Bakker et al., 2004). As erosion continues and the soil gets shallower increasingly severe productivity losses occur under equal erosion rates. The curve is based on depth to a root restrictive layer or 152 cm, whichever is shallower. The following is the scoring curve:

          Rooting Depth Score = a + bx + cx1.5 + dx3 
          a = 1.0000338; b = -0.019773028; c = 0.0011661322; d = -5.1038528e-08; x = rooting depth (cm)

Rooting depth limits:
          Very shallow: < 25 cm 
          Shallow: 25-50 cm 
          Moderately deep: 50-100 cm 
          Deep: 100-150 cm 
          Very deep: >150 cm

Null or zero depth is assigned to the not limiting class (Very deep).

4. Vegetative cover: The earth-cover-kind 1 and 2 for a map unit component is used in the index. If earth-cover-kind is null, then the majority NLCD land cover for a map unit is used. Using ArcMap, Zonal statistics of the USGS National Land Cover Database (NLCD; Landsat-based, 30-meter resolution, land cover database for the Nation) were conducted on gSSURGO FY2017 30-meter raster mapunits. The majority land cover of a mapunit was collected in a table by mapunit key. The table was inserted in the property script as a lookup and used by the fragile soil index interpretation.

Property used: LAND COVER NLCD (Modality - representative value). 

The scoring curve for vegetative cover is based on the percent cover assigned to each earth-cover-kind 1 and 2 for a component. If earth-cover-kind is null, then the majority NLCD land cover for a map unit is used. Vegetative cover can range from 0 to 100%. Percent cover for each earth-cover-kind in shown below:

        Earth Cover Kind	                    Veg. Cover (%)

The scoring curve shape is sigmoid as follows: 

          Veg Cover Score = (a + cx + ex2)(1 + bx +dx2)
          a = 0.99966629; b = -0.018080619; c = -0.019063775; d = 0.00018014742; e = 0.000090710991; x = veg cover (%)

Vegetative cover limits:
          Low vegetative cover: < 30
          Moderate vegetative cover: 30 - 60%
          Moderately-high vegetative cover: 60 - 80%
          High vegetative cover: > 80%

Null vegetative cover is assigned a ""not rated"" for the interpretation.

5. Slope: The slope percent for the component is used in the index.

Property used: SLOPE (Modality - representative value)

The scoring curve for slope was based on the study by Lui et al. (1994). They showed that for slopes between 9 and 50%, the soil loss was linearly related to the sine of the slope angle, similar to what is used in RULSE but takes into account steeper slopes. The shape of the curve in plot of slope percent versus soil loss normalized to 9% is slightly convex from 9 to 50% slopes. The Y axis (soil loss normalized to 9%) was replaced with 0 to 1 to produce the scoring curve. Below 9%, the shape is still convex but less steep.  The scoring curve is as follows:

	Slope score = (a + cx + ex2 + gx3)/(1 + bx + dx2 + fx3)
	a = -0.00097169878; b = -0.085569059; c = 0.022525266; d = 0.0068975356; e = -0.0036133219; f = 8.00000689E-05; g = 0.00024152235; x = slope gradient (%)

Slope limits:
          Very steep: > 45
          Steep: 28 - 45%
          Moderately steep: 16 - 28%
          Strongly sloping: 8 - 16%
          Gently sloping: 3 - 8%
          Nearly level: 0 - 3%

Null slope is assigned a ""not rated"" for the interpretation.

6. Aridity: The De Martonne (1926) aridity index (Am) (as reviewed in Maliva and Missimer, 2012 and Lunga et al., 2011) uses temperature as a proxy for ETp as follows: Am = P/(T + 10) where, P (mm) is the annual precipitation and T (C) the mean annual temperature. The equation is appropriate for temperatures greater than -9.9C. The De Martonne aridity index decreases (approaches zero) with increasing aridity. 

Property used: ARIDITY INDEX (Modality - representative value)

 The shape of the scoring curve is sigmoid as follows:
	Aridity Index score = (a + cx + ex2)/(1 + bx + dx2)
	a = 0.99992575; b = -0.069544299; c = -0.065093715; d = 0.0019192058; e = 0.0010584767; x = aridity index

Aridity index limits (classification according to De Martonne, 1926):
          Very dry: 0 - 5
          Dry: 5 - 15
          Semi-dry: 15 - 20
          Mildly wet: 20 - 30
          Wet: 30 - 60
          Very wet: > 60

Aridity index values greater than 30 are considered not fragile.
Null aridity index is assigned a ""not rated"" for the interpretation.

CO643,Ground Penetrating Radar Penetration,limitation,"Introduction

Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is widely used by a diverse group of service providers that include agronomist, archaeologists, criminologists, engineers, environmental specialists, foresters, geologists, geophysicists, hydrologists, land use managers, and soil scientists. In recent years, GPR has gained recognition in the search for terrorism and military hazards. A common concern of GPR service providers is whether or not GPR will be able to achieve the desired depth of penetration in the soils of a project area. In many soils, high rates of signal attenuation severely restrict penetration depths and limit the suitability of GPR for a large number of applications. In saline and sodic soils, where penetration depths are often less than 10 inches (Daniels, 2004), GPR is unsuited to most applications. In wet clays, where penetration depths are typically less than 40 inches (Doolittle et al., 2002), GPR has very low potentials for most applications. However, GPR is highly suited to most applications in dry sands and gravels, where penetration depths can exceed 160 feet with low frequency antennas (Smith and Jol, 1995). 

Most GPR service providers have limited knowledge of soils and are unable to foretell attenuation rates, penetration depths, and the general suitability of the soils within project areas to GPR. Knowledge of the probable penetration depth and the relative suitability of soils would help service providers assess the appropriateness of using GPR and the likelihood of achieving acceptable results. Soil attribute data contained in the State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) and the Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) data bases have been used to develop thematic maps showing, at different scales and levels of resolution, the relative suitability of soils for many GPR applications. Both STATSGO and SSURGO data bases consist of digital map data, attribute data, and Federal Geographic Data Committee compliant metadata. These data bases are linked to soil interpretation records, which contain data on the physical and chemical properties of approximately 21,000 different soils (USDA-Natural Resources Conservation Service, 1994). 


Factors Influencing the Penetration Depth of GPR

The penetration depth of GPR is determined by antenna frequency and the electrical conductivity of the earthen materials being profiled (Daniels, 2004). Soils having high electrical conductivity rapidly attenuate radar energy, restrict penetration depths, and severely limit the effectiveness of GPR. The electrical conductivity of soils increases with increases in water, clay and soluble salt contents. 

Electrical conductivity is directly related to the amount, distribution, chemical composition, and phase (liquid, solid, or gas) of the soil water (McNeill, 1980). At a given frequency, the attenuation of electromagnetic energy increases with increasing moisture contents (Daniels, 2004). The lack of adequate data on soil moisture and the high spatial and temporal variations in the degree of soil wetness within most soil map units precluded the use of moisture content in the preparation of GPR soil suitability maps. As a consequence, properties selected to prepare these maps principally reflect variations in the clay and soluble salt contents of soils. These properties include clay content and mineralogy, electrical conductivity, sodium absorption ratio, and calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate contents. 

Clays have greater surface areas and can hold more water than the silt and sand fractions at moderate and higher water tensions. Because of their high adsorptive capacity for water and exchangeable cations, clays produce high attenuation losses (Daniels, 2004). As a consequence, the penetration depth of GPR is inversely related to clay content. While soils with more than 35 percent clay are restrictive, soils with less than 10 percent clay are generally favorable to deep penetration with GPR. 

Soils contain various proportions of different clay minerals (e.g., members of kaolin, mica, chlorite, vermiculite, smectite groups). The size, surface area, cation-exchange capacity (CEC), and water holding capacity of clay minerals vary greatly. Variations in electrical conductivity are attributed to differences in the CEC associated with different clay minerals (Saarenketo, 1998). Electrical conductivity increases with increasing CEC (Saarenketo, 1998). Soils with clay fractions dominated by high cation exchange capacity clays (e.g., smectitic and vermiculitic soil mineralogy classes) are more attenuating to GPR than soils with an equivalent percentage of low cation exchange capacity clays (e.g., kaolinitic, gibbsitic, and halloysitic soil mineralogy classes). Soils classified as kaolinitic, gibbsitic, and halloysitic characteristically have low cation-exchange capacity and low base saturation. As a general rule, for soils with comparable clay and moisture contents, greater depths of penetration can be achieved in highly weathered soils of tropical and subtropical regions that have kandic or oxic horizons than in soils of temperate regions that have argillic horizons. Compared with argillic horizons, kandic and oxic horizons have greater concentrations of low activity clays (Soil Survey Staff, 1999).

Electrical conductivity is directly related to the concentration of dissolved salts in the soil solution, as well as the type of exchangeable cations and the degree of dissociation of the salts on soil particles (Soil Survey Staff, 1993). The concentration of salts in the soil solution is dependent upon the degree of water-filled porosity, the soil texture, and the minerals found in soils. In semi-arid and arid regions, soluble salts and exchangeable sodium accumulate in the upper part of some soil profiles. These salts produce high attenuation losses that restrict penetration depths (Doolittle and Collins, 1995). Because of their high electrical conductivity, saline (saturated extract electrical conductivity  4 mmhos cm -1) and sodic (sodium absorption ratio  13) soils are considered unsuited to GPR. 

Calcareous and gypsiferous soils are characterized by layers with secondary accumulations of calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate, respectively. These soils mainly occur in base-rich, alkaline environments in semi-arid and arid regions. High concentrations of calcium carbonate and/or calcium sulfate imply less intense leaching, prevalence of other soluble salts, greater quantities of inherited minerals from parent rock, and accumulations of specific mineral products of weathering (Jackson, 1959). Grant and Schultz (1994) observed a reduction in the depth of GPR signal penetration in soils that have high concentrations of calcium carbonate. 

GPR Soil Indices

Soil properties selected to prepare GPR soil suitability maps are summarized in Table 1. Attribute index values (AIV) were assigned to each of the selected soil properties based on field experiences. Lower AIVs are associated with lower rates of signal attenuation, greater penetration depths, and soil properties that are characteristically more suited to GPR. For clay content, AIVs range from 1 to 5. Mineral soils with clay contents less than 10 percent in all horizons within a depth of 3.3 feet have a very high potential for most GPR applications and are assigned an AIV of 1. Mineral soils with clay contents greater than 60 percent in one or more horizons within a depth of 3.3 feet have a very low potential for most GPR applications and are assigned an index value of 5. A mineralogy override is used for highly weathered soils that are dominated by low activity clay minerals. Based on taxonomic criteria, a textural adjustment is applied to all soils that have kandic or oxic horizons and more than 10 percent clay. Fabric adjustments and separate indices are used for organic soils. Organic soils with more acidic reactions (dysic; AIV of 1) are typically more nutrient deficient and less limiting to GPR than organic soils with more neutral or alkaline soil reactions (euic; AIV of 2). Distinctions are also made for organic soils with mineral layers that are more than 12 inches thick and occur within depths of 4.1 feet (terric taxonomic subgroup). Because of their unsuitability to GPR, saline and sodic soils are assigned an AIV of 6. Based principally on taxonomic criteria, mineral soils with less than 60 percent clay that are characterized by high gypsum and/or calcium carbonate contents are assigned an added AIV of 1. Very fine textured soils (>60 percent clay) have very low potential for GPR and were not assigned this additional AIV.

For each component of a soil map unit, the most limiting condition (highest AIV) for each of the selected properties (clay content, electrical conductivity or SAR, and calcium carbonate or calcium sulfate content) at the soil horizon level is selected. These index values are summed to a depth of 3.3 feet for mineral soils and 4.1 feet for organic soils. The summation of the most limiting conditions represents the component index value (CIV). A CIV is computed for each soil in the map unit. Table 2 shows the relative composition (percentage) of different soil components and their CIVs for a hypothetical soil map unit.

A relative suitability index (SI) is computed for each map unit by summing the percentages of soils with the same CIV. Table 3 shows the results of summing the soil component percentages by the CIVs shown in Table 2. The dominant CIV is 4 for the map unit shown in Table 3. Soils with this index value make up 38 percent of the map unit. However, this map unit is also composed of soils that have more limiting (21%) and more favorable (41%) CIVs. The SI for a map unit represents the most dominant attribute properties, but does not identify or weighs the proportion of other soils that have different CIVs and occur within the map unit.

The final product is a lookup table consisting of the map unit identifiers and dominant GPR suitability indices (SI) shown in Table 4. The dominant SI for the soil components is joined to the map unit identifiers and displayed in graduated colors on digital maps. 

Relative Suitability of Soils for GPR

Soil attribute index values and relative soil suitability indices are based on observed responses from antennas with center frequencies between 100 and 200 MHz. For mineral soils, the inferred SI is based on unsaturated conditions and the absence of contrasting materials within depths of 3.3 feet. Penetration depths and the relative suitability of mineral soils will be less under saturated conditions. Contrasting physical and chemical properties will also affect attenuation rates and penetration depths.

Areas dominated by mineral soil materials with less than 10 percent clay or very deep organic soils with pH values < 4.5 in all layers have very high potential (SI of 1) for GPR applications. Areas with very high potential afford the greatest possibility for deep, high resolution profiling with GPR. However, depending on the ionic concentration of the soil solution and the amounts and types of clay minerals in the soil matrix, signal attenuation and penetration depths will vary. With a 200 MHz antenna, in soils with very high potential for GPR, the effective penetration depth has averaged about 16.5 feet. However, because of variations in textural layering, mineralogy, soil water content, and the ionic concentration of the soil water, the depth of penetration can range from 3.3 to greater than 50 feet. 

Areas dominated by mineral soils with 18 to 35 percent clay or with 35 to 60 percent clay that are mostly low-activity clay minerals have moderate potential (SI of 3) for GPR. Low activity clays are principally associated with older, more intensely weathered soils that form in materials weathered from highly permeable granitic parent rock on the Piedmont and Coastal Plains of southeastern United States. In soils with moderate potential for GPR, the effective penetration depth with a 200 MHz antenna has averaged about 7 feet with a range of about 1.6 to 16 feet. Though penetration depths are restricted, soil polygons with moderate potential are suited to many GPR applications. 

Mineral soils with 35 to 60 percent clay, or calcareous and/or gypsiferous soils with 18 to 35 percent clay have low potential (SI of 4) for GPR. Areas with low potential are very depth restrictive to GPR. In soils with low potential for GPR, the depth of penetration with a 200 MHz antenna has averaged about 1.6 feet with a range of about 0.8 to 6.5 feet. 

Areas that are unsuited (SI >5) to GPR consist of saline and sodic soils. These soil map units are principally restricted to arid and semiarid regions and coastal areas of the United States.

Summary: Military interpretations provide a tool for managing the impact of military training and support activities on soil and soil landscape.  Soils vary in their capacity to support these activities and the ratings reflect limitations that individual soils may have.  Restrictive soil features guide the user in predicting how the soil will respond to management.  The ratings are for the soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use, existing vegetation, or water sources. Site evaluation and planning, however, should consider these items.

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less than the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).  

Scope:  Bivouac areas are tracts of land used intensively as sites for field operation centers for military activity.  Bivouac areas require such site preparation as shaping and leveling in the areas used for tents and parking areas, stabilizing roads and intensively used areas, and installing sanitary facilities and utility lines.  Bivouac areas are also subject to heavy foot traffic and some vehicular traffic.

The MIL - Bivouac Areas interpretation provides information about the soil limitations for use as a bivouac and identifies those soil properties that influence the ease of developing bivouac areas and the performance of the area after development.  Soil properties that influence trafficability and promote the growth of vegetation after heavy use are also important.  For tent or remote camp sites, the limitations would be less restrictive.

Description:  Slope, stoniness, and depth to bedrock or a cemented pan are the main concerns in developing bivouac areas.  For good trafficability, the surface of bivouac area should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under heavy foot traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence trafficability are texture of the surface layer, wetness, permeability, and large stones.  The limitations of slow permeability and clayey surface texture are not as severe in dry regions of the country; however, silty soils may be more of a problem because they are dusty.  Soil properties that influence the growth of plants are depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, permeability, and presence of toxic materials.  Soils that are subject to flooding are particularly hazardous for bivouac areas because of the danger to life and property.

CRITERIA: The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

	1.  Too clayey: Clayey surface layers are slippery and sticky when wet, are slow to dry, and, when dry, are usually hard.  Timing and techniques that are used in preparing a seedbed and in planting the seeds, mechanical use, and large animal hoof impact are affected.  Hard surfaces affect seedling emergence and survival.  These factors should be considered in selecting alternatives for use and management.

	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		= ""occasional"", ""very frequent"" or ""frequent""

	7.  Too Gravelly: High gravel content in the soil surface may impede road and trail construction and maintenance.

	Property used: ""COARSE FRAGMENTS 2 to 75MM IN SURFACE LAYER (TX)"" (Modality - high, low, and representative value)
			
	Restrictive limits:

		Not limiting		 =< 0.1%
		
	Null > 10 inch rock fragment data are assigned to the Not limiting class.

	13. Too acid: Soils that are too acid restrict plant growth and site reclamation.  Acid soils generally contain sulfuric acid, have low base saturation, and have the potential for aluminum and/or manganese toxicity.  The addition of soil amendments and/or the selection of species that are tolerant to acid conditions are management considerations.

Summary: Military interpretations provide a tool for managing the impact of military train and support activities on soil and soil landscape.  Soils vary in their capacity to support these activities and the ratings reflect limitations that individual soils may have.  Restricting soil features guide the user in predicting how the soil will respond to management.  The rating are for the soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use, existing vegetation, or water sources. Site evaluation and planning, however, should consider these items.

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).  

Scope:  The soil interpretations for Excavations for Crew-Served Weapon Fighting Positions are designed to be used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for sites to be used and excavated weapon emplacements.  As part of the interpretation process, the rating applies to each soil in its present condition and does not consider present land use.  The limitation rating provided is based on the influence of existing soil properties for that use.
 
The soil feature(s) is identified for its affects on excavation, site preparation, and ease of maintenance.  These soil feature(s) also determines the performance to be expected after weapons have been placed and the kind and degree of future maintenance required to maintain the site and weapon readiness.  Minor soil features are not identified or considered as part of the initial rating process but could be important factors where the major soil feature restrictions are overcome through design application.  Use of the soil interpretation rating guides in the planning and evaluation process allows the user to identify and recommend site selection and to plan alternative measures that minimize impacts on the soil resource.

Description:  Excavations for Crew-Served Weapon Fighting Positions are trenches or holes dug in the soil to a maximum depth of 5 or 6 feet.  They are used for troop and weapon protection and support bases.  The excavations are most commonly made by trenching machines or backhoes.

Soil properties and qualities, limits, and restrictive features used in rating are based on the soil properties that influence ease of digging, resistance to sloughing, and weapon readiness.  Depth to bedrock or cemented pan, hardness of bedrock or a cemented pan, and the amount of large stones influence the ease of digging, filling, and compacting.

Summary: Military interpretations provide a tool for managing the impact of military train and support activities on soil and soil landscape.  Soils vary in their capacity to support these activities and the ratings reflect limitations that individual soils may have.  Restricting soil features guide the user in predicting how the soil will respond to management.  The rating are for the soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use, existing vegetation, or water sources. Site evaluation and planning, however, should consider these items.

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's property within 60 cm (24 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).  

Scope:  The soil interpretations for Excavations for Individual Fighting Positions are designed to be used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for sites to be used and excavated for individual fighting emplacements.  As part of the interpretation process, the rating applies to each soil in its natural condition and does not consider present land use.  The limitation rating provided is based on the influence of existing soil properties for that use.
 
The soil feature(s) is identified for its affects on excavation, site preparation, and ease of maintenance.  These soil feature(s) also determines the performance to be expected after fighting positions have been placed and the kind and degree of future maintenance required to maintain the site and position readiness.  Minor soil features are not identified or considered as part of the initial rating process but could be important factors where the major soil feature restrictions are overcome through design application.  Use of the soil interpretation rating guides in the planning and evaluation process allows the user to identify and recommend site selection and to plan alternative measures that minimize impacts on the soil resource.

CO643,MIL - Helicopter Landing Zones (DOD),limitation,"MIL - Helicopter Landing Zones

Summary: Military interpretations provide a tool for managing the impact of military training and support activities on soil and the soil landscape.  Soils vary in their capacity to support these activities and the ratings reflect limitations that individual soils may have.  Restrictive soil features guide the user in predicting how the soil will respond to management.  The rating are for the soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use, existing vegetation, or water sources.  Site evaluation and planning, however, should consider these items.

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's surface property has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).  

Scope:  The soil interpretations for Helicopter Landing Zones are designed to be used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for sites to be used as landing zones.  As part of the interpretation process, the rating applies to each soil in its present condition and does not consider present land use.  The limitation rating provided is based on the influence of existing soil properties for that use.

The soil feature(s) is identified for its affects on site preparation and ease of maintenance.  These soil feature(s) also determines the performance to be expected after landing zones have been constructed and the kind and degree of future maintenance required to maintain the site readiness.  Minor soil features are not identified or considered as part of the initial rating process but could be important factors where the major soil feature restrictions are overcome through design application.  Use of the soil interpretation rating guides in the planning and evaluation process allows the user to identify and recommend site selection and to plan alternative measures that minimize impacts on the soil resource.

Description:  Helicopter Landing Zones are areas that are developed to land helicopters and transport troops and supplies.  Soil properties and qualities, limits, and restrictive features used in rating are based on the soil properties that influence construction, maintenance, and readiness of helicopter landing zones.  Dusty surface layer, slope, or the amount of large stones influence the development and functionality of an area for landing helicopters.  Flooding or ponding may restrict the period when the landing zone can be used.

CO643,MIL - Trafficability Veh. Type 1 1-pass wet season (DOD),suitability,"MIL - Trafficability Veh. Type 1 1-pass wet season

Summary:  Military category type 1 vehicles are lightweight vehicles with low contact pressure (less than 2.0 pounds per square inch) such as amphibious tracked vehicles used to carry cargo.  Soils trafficability during the wet season is the capacity of soils to support vehicles in category type 1.  Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data such as topography and soil data and weather conditions.  The Military Trafficability interpretations are base on procedures and criteria contained Army Field Manual - 5-430-00-1; Chapter Seven and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning.  Commanders and engineers must be cautious as the interpreted results can vary greatly.

The trafficability of fine-grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine-grained material to behave like fine-grained soils when wet is more difficult to assess than trafficability in coarse-grained soils (clean sands).  Relationships that describe the soil-vehicle interactions are based on soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large surface stones, and slope are the basis for soil trafficability interpretations.

Rating classes ""Excellent,"" ""Good"", ""Fair"", or ""Poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic and considers soil features that affect trafficability.  An ""Excellent"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that do not limit trafficability and have very low maintenance.  A ""Good"" rating indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use.  Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  A ""Fair"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.  A ""Poor"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use.  Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management.  Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Scope:  The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or man-made obstacles (such as forests or ditches) nor information on vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning).  These interpretations are developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subjected to freeze-thaw cycles, if they are not frozen at the time of traffic.

Trafficability performances were estimated for one vehicle pass.  Today most relations are used for one pass and the combined effects on vehicle performance of terrain features such as soil, vegetation, and slope can only accurately be determined using the computerized Army mobility prediction system contained in the NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM).  The engineering relationships that produce vehicle speed predictions or GO/NO GO performance based on measured terrain and vehicle characteristics are contained in the NRMM.

Description:  Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and unified class are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability.  For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under repeated traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are unified class and their relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness.

Summary:  Military category type 1 vehicles are lightweight vehicles with low contact pressure (less than 2.0 pounds per square inch).  Soils trafficability during the wet season is the capacity of soils to support vehicles in category type 1.  Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data such as topography and soil data and weather conditions.  The Military Trafficability interpretations are base on procedures and criteria contained Army Field Manual - 5-430-00-1; Chapter Seven and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning.  Commanders and engineers must be cautious as the interpreted results can vary greatly.

The trafficability of fine-grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine-grained material to behave like fine-grained soils when wet is more difficult to assess than trafficability in coarse-grained soils (clean sands).  Relationships that describe the soil-vehicle interactions are based on soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large surface stones, and slope are the basis for soil trafficability interpretations.

Rating classes ""Excellent,"" ""Good"", ""Fair"", or ""Poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic and considers soil features that affect trafficability.  An ""Excellent"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that do not limit trafficability and have very low maintenance.  A ""Good"" rating indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use.  Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  A ""Fair"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.  A ""Poor"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use.  Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management.  Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Scope:  The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or man-made obstacles (such as forests or ditches) nor information on vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning).  These interpretations are developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subjected to freeze-thaw cycles, if they are not frozen at the time of traffic.

Trafficability performances were estimated for a maximum of 50 vehicle passes in the same ruts.  Today most relations are used for one pass and the combined effects on vehicle performance of terrain features such as soil, vegetation, and slope can only accurately be determined using the computerized Army mobility prediction system contained in the NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM).  The engineering relationships that produce vehicle speed predictions or GO/NO GO performance based on measured terrain and vehicle characteristics are contained in the NRMM.

Description:  Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and unified class are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability.  For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under repeated traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are unified class and their relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness.

CO643,MIL - Trafficability Veh. Type 2 50-passes wet season (DOD),suitability,"MIL - Trafficability Veh. Type 2 50-pass wet season

Summary:  Military category type-2 vehicles are engineer and high speed tractors with comparatively wide tracks and low contact pressures.  Soils trafficability during the wet season is the capacity of soils to support vehicles in category type 2.  Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data such as topography and soil data and weather conditions.  The Military Trafficability interpretations are base on procedures and criteria contained Army Field Manual - 5-430-00-1; Chapter Seven and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning.  Commanders and engineers must be cautious as the interpreted results can vary greatly.

The trafficability of fine-grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine-grained material to behave like fine-grained soils when wet is more difficult to assess than trafficability in coarse-grained soils (clean sands).  Relationships that describe the soil-vehicle interactions are based on soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large surface stones, and slope are the basis for soil trafficability interpretations.

Rating classes ""Excellent,"" ""Good"", ""Fair"", or ""Poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic and considers soil features that affect trafficability.  An ""Excellent"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that do not limit trafficability and have very low maintenance.  A ""Good"" rating indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use.  Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  A ""Fair"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.  A ""Poor"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use.  Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management.  Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Scope:  The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or man-made obstacles (such as forests or ditches) nor information on vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning).  These interpretations are developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subjected to freeze-thaw cycles, if they are not frozen at the time of traffic.

Trafficability performances were estimated for a maximum of 50 vehicle passes in the same ruts.  Today most relations are used for one pass and the combined effects on vehicle performance of terrain features such as soil, vegetation, and slope can only accurately be determined using the computerized Army mobility prediction system contained in the NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM).  The engineering relationships that produce vehicle speed predictions or GO/NO GO performance based on measured terrain and vehicle characteristics are contained in the NRMM.

Description:  Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and unified class are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability.  For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under repeated traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are unified class and their relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness.

An ""Excellent"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that do not limit trafficability and have very low maintenance.  A ""Good"" rating indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use.  Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  A ""Fair"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.  A ""Poor"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use.  Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management.  Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Scope:  The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or man-made obstacles (such as forests or ditches) nor information on vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning).  These interpretations are developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subjected to freeze-thaw cycles, if they are not frozen at the time of traffic.

Trafficability performances were estimated for one vehicle pass.  Today most relations are used for one pass and the combined effects on vehicle performance of terrain features such as soil, vegetation, and slope can only accurately be determined using the computerized Army mobility prediction system contained in the NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM).  The engineering relationships that produce vehicle speed predictions or GO/NO GO performance based on measured terrain and vehicle characteristics are contained in the NRMM.

Description:  Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and unified class are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability.  For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under repeated traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are unified class and their relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness.

Summary:   Military category type-3 vehicles are tractors with average contact pressures, tanks with comparatively low contact pressures, and some trailed vehicles with very low contact pressures.  Soils trafficability during the wet season is the capacity of soils to support vehicles in category type 3.  Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data such as topography and soil data and weather conditions.  The Military Trafficability interpretations are base on procedures and criteria contained Army Field Manual - 5-430-00-1; Chapter Seven and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning.  Commanders and engineers must be cautious as the interpreted results can vary greatly.

The trafficability of fine-grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine-grained material to behave like fine-grained soils when wet is more difficult to assess than trafficability in coarse-grained soils (clean sands).  Relationships that describe the soil-vehicle interactions are based on soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large surface stones, and slope are the basis for soil trafficability interpretations.

Rating classes ""Excellent,"" ""Good"", ""Fair"", or ""Poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic and considers soil features that affect trafficability.  An ""Excellent"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that do not limit trafficability and have very low maintenance.  A ""Good"" rating indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use.  Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  A ""Fair"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.  A ""Poor"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use.  Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management.  Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Summary:  Military category type-4 vehicles are most medium tanks, tractors with high contact pressures, and all-wheel-drive trucks and trailed vehicles with low contact pressures.  Examples include heavy tracked vehicles in the range of 120,000 to 140,000 pound vehicle weights to wheeled vehicles in the range of 17,000 to 25,000 vehicle weight (Truck, van, 2-1/2 ton, 6x6, M109A1).  Soils trafficability during the wet season is the capacity of soils to support vehicles in category type 4.  Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data such as topography and soil data and weather conditions.  The Military Trafficability interpretations are base on procedures and criteria contained Army Field Manual - 5-430-00-1; Chapter Seven and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning.  Commanders and engineers must be cautious as the interpreted results can vary greatly.

The trafficability of fine-grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine-grained material to behave like fine-grained soils when wet is more difficult to assess than trafficability in coarse-grained soils (clean sands).  Relationships that describe the soil-vehicle interactions are based on soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large surface stones, and slope are the basis for soil trafficability interpretations.

Rating classes ""Excellent,"" ""Good"", ""Fair"", or ""Poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic and considers soil features that affect trafficability.  An ""Excellent"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that do not limit trafficability and have very low maintenance.  A ""Good"" rating indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use.  Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  A ""Fair"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.  A ""Poor"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use.  Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management.  Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Scope:  The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or man-made obstacles (such as forests or ditches) nor information on vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning).  These interpretations are developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subjected to freeze-thaw cycles, if they are not frozen at the time of traffic.

Trafficability performances were estimated for one vehicle pass.  Today most relations are used for one pass and the combined effects on vehicle performance of terrain features such as soil, vegetation, and slope can only accurately be determined using the computerized Army mobility prediction system contained in the NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM).  The engineering relationships that produce vehicle speed predictions or GO/NO GO performance based on measured terrain and vehicle characteristics are contained in the NRMM.

Description:  Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and unified class are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability.  For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under repeated traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are unified class and their relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness.

Summary:  Military category type-4 vehicles are most medium tanks, tractors with high contact pressures, and all-wheel-drive trucks and trailed vehicles with low contact pressures.  Soils trafficability during the dry season is the capacity of soils to support vehicles in category type 4.  Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data such as topography and soil data and weather conditions.  The Military Trafficability interpretations are base on procedures and criteria contained Army Field Manual - 5-430-00-1; Chapter Seven and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning.  Commanders and engineers must be cautious as the interpreted results can vary greatly.

The trafficability of fine-grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine-grained material to behave like fine-grained soils is more difficult to assess than trafficability in coarse-grained soils (clean sands).  Relationships that describe the soil-vehicle interactions are based on soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large surface stones, and slope are the basis for soil trafficability interpretations.

Rating classes ""Excellent,"" ""Good"", ""Fair"", or ""Poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic and considers soil features that affect trafficability.  An ""Excellent"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that do not limit trafficability and have very low maintenance.  A ""Good"" rating indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use.  Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  A ""Fair"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.  A ""Poor"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use.  Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management.  Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Scope:  The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or man-made obstacles (such as forests or ditches) nor information on vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning).  These interpretations are developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subjected to freeze-thaw cycles, if they are not frozen at the time of traffic.

Trafficability performances were estimated for a minimum number of vehicle passes (1) or a maximum of 50 vehicles in the same ruts.  Today most relations are used for one pass and the combined effects on vehicle performance of terrain features such as soil, vegetation, and slope can only accurately be determined using the computerized Army mobility prediction system contained in the NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM).  The engineering relationships that produce vehicle speed predictions or GO/NO GO performance based on measured terrain and vehicle characteristics are contained in the NRMM.

Description:  Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and unified class are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability.  For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under repeated traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are unified class and their relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness.

CRITERIA: The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

Dustiness is a concern for human health as well as aesthetic reasons.  Dust generation from roads is a significant source of inhalable particulate matter.  Two dust particle sizes are recognized: PM10 and PM2.5, relating to particles of aerodynamic diameters of 10 and 2.5 microns, respectively.  The capacity of soils to produce dust particles has been found by Carvacho et al (2004) to be directly related to the clay or silt content of the soil.  Thus, the PM10 or PM2.5 generation capacity of a soil is inversely proportional to its sand content.  Gypsum is also related to dustiness because the soft crystals are relatively easily crushed to silt and clay size particles which can then be picked up by air.

Other major variables in dust generation are moisture content, vehicle size, and the amount of traffic on the road.

The ""Dryness Index"" accounts for the moisture content of the surface.  In a dry, hot environment, the generation of dust is greater than in a cool, moist environment.  Thus dust generation is directly proportional to temperature and inversely proportional to rainfall.

An array of materials is available for overcoming dust limitations (Gebhart et al, 1999).

CO643,Farm and Garden Composting Facility - Surface,limitation,"Farm and Garden Composting Facility - Surface

Background

Produce farms, urban areas, and suburban neighborhoods can produce large amounts of organic material that may be viewed as waste but is actually a valuable resource.  This material may 
consist of leaves, grass clippings, small tree limbs, and other herbaceous materials.  Composting these materials provides a good source of organic matter to be used as a soil amendment. 

Biological degradation of organic materials forms the basis for composting.  This biological process depends on the active metabolism of microorganisms in a suitable micro-environment. 
The six critical factors for the transformation of organic materials into compost are microorganisms, heat, air, water, carbon, and nitrogen.

The microorganisms that carry out biological degradation for composting often are found in the soil or on the surface of leaves.  These microorganisms thrive in a surface or subsurface 
microclimate with free circulation of air, free flow of water, and a temperature well above freezing. The microorganisms also require carbon as food for energy and growth, as well as 
nitrogen for protein and rebuilding cells.

Composting facilities are designed to provide these six critical factors in relative proportions so that the process of biological degradation is sustained.  Deficits in any of the 
critical factors, or imbalances among them, may result in extremely slow composting or a dormant composting system. Mixing of materials also redistributes heat, air, and water and will 
speed the process of biological degradation. Large facilities may provide mechanical mixing of the compost materials. Smaller facilities may rely on manual turning of the materials or may 
add some materials that are too large to compost in order to create channels for air flow through the pile. 

Mean Annual Precipitation (MAP) and Mean Annual Air Temperature (MAAT) are measures of the soil micro-climate that affects the rate of composting.  Both MAP and MAAT are available from 
the soil survey database.  Composting is most rapid in warm, moist areas that generally have MAP between 450 and 1250 mm together with MAAT between 10 and 22 degrees Celsius.  The optimal 
temperature inside the compost pile is 10 to 15.5 degrees Celsius. In colder areas the rate of composting may be increased by insulating the compost pile on all sides with an extra layer 
of high carbon materials such as hay or newspaper. To avoid extreme cold or rainforest conditions, the composting may be done inside a protected area or a building.  The optimal moisture 
for composting is field capacity, or freely drained but moist. Moisture may need to be added to the compost pile especially if the organic materials are dry such as chipped lumber. 

The ratio of carbon to nitrogen in the organic materials is perhaps the hardest part of the process to regulate.  Active compost piles need a carbon to nitrogen ratio of about 30:1 (30 
units of carbon to 1 unit of nitrogen). Many common materials such as leaves and lumber are high in carbon and require balanced inputs of materials that are high in nitrogen such as 
coffee grounds or manures and urines.  Often the materials high in nitrogen are less available or more difficult to transport to the composting site. Materials intended for composting may 
vary in their carbon to nitrogen ratio due to many factors and testing of materials is recommended before large scale operations begin. A few C:N examples are given in table 1.

Publications (with estimated ratios of carbon to nitrogen)

Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as a ""Farm and Garden Composting Facility - Surface"".  If a soil's property 
within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership 
indices for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""Site for Composting Facility"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not 
considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited 
(rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Site for Farm and Garden Composting Facility - Surface is the site location for placement of a composting facility without the use of a liner or placement on concrete pad. The composting 
facility is to process raw organic by-products into biologically stable organic material as outlined in the NRCS conservation practice standard ""Composting Facility"" (code 317). 

Scope: National

The bottom elevation of the composting facility shall be above the seasonal high water table and on soils with an acceptable permeability that does not allow materials to contaminate the 
ground water. Compost facilities should be located outside of floodplains.  However, if site restrictions require location within a floodplain, they shall be protected from inundation or 
damage from a 25-year flood event, or larger. Locate compost facilities so prevailing winds and landscape elements such as building arrangement, landforms and vegetation minimize odors 
and protect the visual resource. Direct any contaminated runoff from compost facilities to an appropriate storage or treatment facility for further management.

Suitability of a soil for use as a site for composting should be on soils with an acceptable permeability that does not allow materials to contaminate the ground water. Slope affects the 
ease of accessing and manipulating the compost material.  It also will affect runoff from the site. If slope is limiting, then consult the ""Site for Composting Facility  Subsurface"" 
interpretation.


Soil interpretations for locating a site for composting are used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for the practice.  The rating is for soils in 
their present condition and does not consider present land use.


Criteria used:


1.  Depth to saturated zone: Shallow depth to water table limits the site for use as a composting facility.  Soils that are shallow to water are also difficult to reclaim and revegetate, 
and contamination from leaching may create health and environmental hazards.  Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first layer where soil moisture layer status is wet or 
saturated during any month.

	Property used: HIGH WATER TABLE DEPTH MINIMUM (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		 < 50 cm
		Somewhat limiting	=> 50 to =< 100 cm
		Not limiting		 > 100 cm
		
	Null depth to saturation is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	
2.  Flooding:  If the number of months a soil component has frequent or occasional flooding falls within the following parameters then the rule returns a value greater than 0 and flooding 
is a limiting feature:

Flooding Frequency	Months
------------------	------
Frequent		>0
Occasional		>2


3.  Fragments in soil:  Large stone impede the workability of the soil and restrict trafficability of heavy machinery and site reclamation.  Soil feature considered is percent by weight 
rock fragments > 10 inches in size in the surface soil layer.



	Property evaluated: WTD_AVG FRAGS > 250mm 0-30cm OR ABOVE RESTRICTION (Modality - high, low, and representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		 > 15 percent
		Somewhat Limiting 	=> 5 to 15 percent
		Not limiting		 < 5 percent
		
	Null surface fragment coverage is assigned to the ""not rated"" class.	



4.  Surface fragments:  Soils that have large fragments on the surface have reduced trafficability.  The large rock fragments on the surface must be removed.  Rock fragment coverage 
criteria are as follows.


	Property evaluated: FRAGMENTS >=250MM ON THE SURFACE  (Modality - high, low, and representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		 > 15 percent
		Somewhat limiting 	=> 3 to 15 percent
		Not limiting		 < 3 percent
		
	Null surface fragment coverage is assigned to the Well suited class.



5.  Seepage:  The soil horizon with the maximum Ksat governs the leaching and seepage potential of the soil.   When this rate is high, transmission of fluids into and through the soil is 
unimpeded and leaching and seepage may become an environmental, health, and performance concern.  Soil feature considered is the layer with the maximum Ksat within a depth of 200cm.

            Property used: KSAT HIGHEST MINIMUM, 0-200CM OR FIRST RESTRICTION (Modality - high, low, representative value)

            Restriction limits:
                    Limiting                 	> 42.0 micrometers/sec
                    Somewhat Limiting       	 > 14.1 and <= 42.0 micrometers/sec
                    Not limiting           	 =< 14.1 micrometers/sec

            Null Ksat values are assigned to the ""Not rated"" class.


6.  Depth to permafrost: Permafrost (permanently frozen soil layer) restricts or effects excavation, manipulation, transport, stability, and workability of the soil material.  Soil 
features considered are restrictive feature depth and where kind is permafrost or USDA TEXTURE (IN-LIEU-OF) is ""cpf"" or USDA TEXTURE MODIFIER is ""pf"".
	
	Property used: DEPTH TO PERMAFROST (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		 < 50cm
		Somewhat limiting 	=> 50 to =< 100cm
		Not limiting		 > 100cm
		
	Null depths are assigned  to the Not limiting class.
OR
		
	Property used: USDA TEXTURE (IN-LIEU-OF) (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting	= ""cpf""
		Not limiting	not = ""cpf""
		
	Null USDA Texture (In-Lieu-Of) are assigned to the Not limiting class.
OR
		
	Property used: USDA TEXTURE MODIFIER (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting	= ""pf""
		Not limiting	not = ""pf""
		
	Null USDA Texture Modifier are assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	
	
7.  Ponding:  If the number of months a soil component has frequent or occasional ponding falls within the following parameters then the rule returns a value greater than 0 and ponding is 
a limiting feature:

Ponding Frequency	Months
-----------------	------
Frequent		>0
Occasional		>2



8.  Mean annual precipitation: Localities that have low rainfall are limited for use as composting facilities.  In places that have low rainfall, moisture will need to be added to 
maintain biological activity in the composting mass.  The site feature considered is mean annual precipitation.

	Property used: PRECIPITATION (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		 < 400 mm
		Somewhat limiting	=> 400-1200 mm
		Not limiting		 > 1200 mm
		
	Null precipitation is assigned to the ""Not rated"" class.
	
	
	
9.  Slope:  The slope of the soil surface influences its trafficability for equipment and also can cause erosion hazard if steep.

	Property evaluated: SLOPE (Modality - high, low, and representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		> 8 percent  
		Somewhat limiting 	<= 8 to 3 percent
		Not limiting		< 3 percent
		
	Null slopes are assigned to the Not rated class.
	
	
	
10.  Low strength: Soils with high AASHTO Group Index have low strength which affects the soil's traffic-supporting capacity.  This condition is only partially restrictive when clay 
mineralogy is kaolinitic.  Soil feature considered is the AASHTO Group Index of the
thickest soil layer between 25 and 100cm or above a cemented restrictive layer and taxonomic family mineralogy.

        Property used: AASHTO GROUP INDEX NUMBER THICKEST LAYER IN DEPTH 10-40 in. (Modality - high, low, representative value)

        Restriction limits:
                Limiting                	=> 8
                Somewhat limiting        	> 5 to < 8
                Not limiting           	 	=< 5

        Null AASHTO Group Index values are assigned to the ""Not rated"".
        
        
        
11.  Mean annual air temperature: Localities that have very low or very high mean annual air temperature are limited for use as composting facilities.  In places that have low mean annual 
air temperature, the onset of decomposition may be delayed by low biological activity in the composting mass.  The additional expense of covering or insulating the composting mass may be 
incurred.  In very warm areas, adding extra water and more frequent turning of the mass adds to the cost of composting.  The site feature considered is mean annual air temperature.

	Property used: MEAN ANNUAL AIR TEMPERATURE (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		 <= 8 and >30 degrees C 
		Somewhat limiting	 8 to <=10 and 22 to <=30 degrees C
		Not limiting		 >10 to <=22 degrees C
		
	Null mean annual air temperature is assigned to the ""Not rated"" class.

12.  Piping: Fine textured soils high in sodium and gypsum content with low cohesion and liquid limits are subject to piping and are limited for use in building embankments, dikes, and 
levees.   The interpretive model uses the maximum sodium or gypsum rating index and adds the low cohesion index.  This sum is compared to the liquid limit index and the lowest index is 
applied to the parent rule.

	{Soil feature considered is the maximum percent gypsum found in the soil layers.

CO643,ENG - Unpaved Local Roads and Streets,limitation,"Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Unpaved Local Roads and Streets"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Unpaved Local Roads and Streets"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Unpaved local roads and streets are those roads and streets that carry traffic year round but have a graded surface of local soil material or aggregate. 

Scope: National

The roads and streets consist of
(1) the underlying local soil material, either cut or fill, which is called ""the sub-grade"";
(2) the surface, which may be the same as the subgrade or may have aggrate such as crushed limestone added.

They are graded to shed water, and conventional drainage measures are provided.  These roads and streets are built mainly from the soil at hand.

Soil interpretations for local roads and streets are used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for the practice.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Scope: National

Soil properties and qualities that affect local roads and streets are those that influence the ease of excavation and grading and the traffic-supporting capacity.  The properties and qualities that affect the ease of excavation and grading are hardness of bedrock or a cemented pan, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, depth to a water table, flooding, the amount of large stones, and slope.  The properties that affect traffic-supporting capacity are soil strength as inferred from the AASHTO group index and the Unified classification, subsidence, shrink-swell behavior, potential frost action, and depth to the seasonal high water table.  The dust generating tendacy of the soil is also considered.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

	1.  Depth to hard bedrock: Shallow depth to hard bedrock limits site preparation such as shaping and leveling and restricts installation of small buildings and roads or streets. Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restrictive type is ""bedrock (lithic)"". Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table.

	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		 < 50cm
		Somewhat limiting	=> 50 to < 100cm
		Not limiting		=> 100cm
		
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	2.  Flooding: Flooding has the potential to transport agricultural waste off site and pollute surface waters.  Flooding also limits building, recreational, and sanitary facility use and management of these soils.  Soil feature considered is maximum flooding frequency classes over 12 months.

	Property used: FLOODING FREQUENCY (Maximum Duration) (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		= ""occasional"" or ""very frequent"" or ""frequent""
		Somewhat limiting	= ""very rare"" or ""rare""
		Not limiting		= ""none""
		
	Null frequency is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	3.  Content of large stones: Large stone impede the workability of the soil and restrict trafficability of heavy machinery and site reclamation.  Soil feature considered is the weighted average percentage of rock fragments of size greater than 75mm in the horizons above a restrictive feature or from 0 to 100 cm deep.

	Property used: FRAGMENTS > 75MM WEIGHTED AVE. IN DEPTH 0-100CM (Modality - high, low, representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:

		Somewhat limiting	>= 25% to <= 50%
		Not limiting		< 25%
		
	Null fragment data are assigned Not rated.
	
	4.  Depth to permafrost: Permafrost (permanently frozen soil layer) restricts or effects excavation, manipulation, transport, stability, and workability of the soil material.  Soil features considered are restrictive feature depth and where kind is permafrost or USDA TEXTURE (IN-LIEU-OF) is ""cpf"" or USDA TEXTURE MODIFIER is ""pf"".

	17. Dustiness is a concern for human health as well as aesthetic reasons.  Dust generation from roads is a significant source of inhalable particulate matter.  Two dust particle sizes are recognized: PM10 and PM2.5, relating to particles of aerodynamic diameters of 10 and 2.5 microns, respectively.  The capacity of soils to produce dust particles has been found by Carvacho et al (2004) to be directly related to the clay or silt content of the soil.  Thus, the PM10 or PM2.5 generation capacity of a soil is inversely proportional to its sand content.  Gupsum is also related to dustiness because the soft crystals are relatively easily crushed to silt and clay size particles which can then be picked up by air.

Other major variables in dust generation are moisture content, vehicle size, and the amount of traffic on the road.

The ""Dryness Index"" accounts for the moisture content of the surface.  In a dry, hot environment, the generation of dust is greater than in a cool, moist environment.  Thus dust generation is directly proportional to temperature and inversely proportional to rainfall.

An array of materials is available for overcoming dust limitations (Gebhart et al, 1999).

CO643,ENG - Small Commercial Buildings,limitation,"Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Small Commercial Buildings"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Small Commercial Buildings"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Small commercial buildings are those buildings that are less than three stories without basements.  The foundation is assumed to be spread footings of reinforced concrete at a depth of 2 feet or at the depth of maximum frost penetration, whichever is deeper. 

Scope: National

Soil properties influence the development of building and construction sites, including the selection of the site, the design of the structure, construction, performance, and after construction maintenance.  The soil interpretations for small commercial buildings are used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for the practice.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Ratings are based on properties and qualities affecting the capacity of the soil to support a load without movement and those that affect excavation and construction costs.  The properties and qualities affecting load-supporting capacity without movement are presence of a high water table, flooding, and the shrink-swell behavior and compressibility of the soils.  Compressibility is inferred from the Unified classification.  Properties influencing the ease and amount of excavation are flooding, a high water table, slope, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, hardness of bedrock or a cemented pan, and the amount and size of coarse fragments.

              15.  Roads, pipelines, and structures built on soils containing gypsum are susceptible to damage from differential settling if the soil gypsum should dissolve to due the addition of more water to the soil than can be removed by evapotranspiration.  Subsidence is estimated from the gypsum content of the soil.  Other soluble salts may also contribute to the loss of volume of the soil.  

Assumptions:

* Differential subsidence is assumed to always occur, rather than an equidimensional settling.
* Water as irrigation, leakage, septic systems, or whatever is assumed to be applied.  If no water is added to the soil, no dissolution occurs and therefore no subsidence.
* Dissolution kinetics are assumed to be such that the settling is observable in our lifetimes.
* The size of the structure has an influence on the tolerable amount of distortion due to settling.
* The age of the structure influences the amount of damage it will sustain if differential subsidence occurs.
* The particle size of the gypsum will influence the dissolution rate.  A generic rate is assumed here.

CO643,ENG - Shallow Excavations,limitation,"Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as ""Shallow Excavations"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Shallow Excavations"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Shallow excavations are trenches or holes dug in the soil to a maximum depth of 5 or 6 feet.  They are used for pipelines, sewer lines, telephone and power transmission lines, basements, open ditches, grave sites, etc.  The excavations are most commonly made by trenching machines or backhoes.

Scope: National

Soil properties influence the development of building and construction sites, including the selection of the site, the design of the structure, construction, performance, and after construction maintenance.  The soil interpretations for shallow excavations are used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for the practice.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Ratings are based on the soil properties that influence ease of digging and resistance to sloughing.  Depth to bedrock or cemented pan, hardness of bedrock or a cemented pan, and the amount of large stones influence the ease of digging, filling, and compacting.  Depth to the seasonal high water table and flooding may restrict the period when excavations can be made.  Slope influences the ease of using machinery.  Soil texture and depth to water table influence the resistance to sloughing.

              15.  Dustiness is a concern for human health as well as aesthetic reasons.  Dust generation from roads is a significant source of inhalable particulate matter.  Two dust particle sizes are recognized: PM10 and PM2.5, relating to particles of aerodynamic diameters of 10 and 2.5 microns, respectively.  The capacity of soils to produce dust particles has been found by Carvacho et al (2004) to be directly related to the clay or silt content of the soil.  Thus, the PM10 or PM2.5 generation capacity of a soil is inversely proportional to its sand content.  Gypsum is also related to dustiness because the soft crystals are relatively easily crushed to silt and clay size particles which can then be picked up by air.

Other major variables in dust generation are moisture content and the amount of traffic on the soil.

The ""Dryness Index"" accounts for the moisture content of the surface.  In a dry, hot environment, the generation of dust is greater than in a cool, moist environment.  Thus dust generation is directly proportional to temperature and inversely proportional to rainfall.

An array of materials is available for overcoming dust limitations (Gebhart et al, 1999).

CO643,ENG - Sewage Lagoons,limitation,"Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as ""Sewage Lagoons"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""Sewage Lagoons"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Sewage lagoons are shallow ponds constructed to hold sewage while aerobic bacteria decompose the wastes.  Lagoons have a nearly level floor surrounded by cut slopes or embankments of compacted, relatively impervious soil material.  Relatively impervious soil for the lagoon floor and sides is desirable to minimize seepage and contamination of local ground water.  

Scope: National

Farm and ranch homesteads, outbuildings, and recreational facilities require a means to safely dispose of effluent. Sewage lagoons interpretations are a tool for guiding the user in site selection for safe disposal of liquid effluent.  The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or flood water.  Potential contamination may be reduced or eliminated by installing systems designed to overcome or reduce the effects of the limiting soil property.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Soil permeability is a critical property in evaluating a soil for sewage lagoons.  Most porous soils will eventually seal when being used for a sewage lagoon.  Until they do, however, the hazard of pollution is severe.  Soils that have a permeability rate that exceeds 2 inches per hour generally are too porous for the proper operation of sewage lagoons and may cause contamination.  Fractured bedrock within a depth of 40 inches may create a pollution hazard.  Bedrock and cemented pans create construction problems.

Slope must be gentle enough and the soil material must be thick enough over bedrock or a cemented pan to make smoothing practical so that the lagoon is uniformly deep throughout.

If floodwater overtops the lagoon, it interferes with the functioning of the lagoon and carries away polluting sewage before sufficient decomposition has taken place.  Ordinarily, soils susceptible to flooding have a severe limitation for sewage lagoons.  If floodwater velocities are slow and flooding is rarely deep enough to overtop the lagoon embankment, the susceptibility to flooding does not constitute a severe limitation rating.

Soils that contain a large amount of organic matter are not suitable for the floor of an aerobic lagoon.  The organic matter promotes an anaerobic rather than aerobic environment.

Depth to water table is important if it influences the water level in the lagoon.  If it does, a pollution hazard exists.  Sometimes depth to water table is disregarded if the lagoon floor is of slowly permeable soil material that is at least 4 feet thick.  Soils that contain excess rock fragments greater than 3 inches are undesirable sites because the fragments interfere with the manipulation and compaction needed to prepare the lagoon floor.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Septic tank absorption fields are subsurface systems of tile or perforated pipe that distribute effluent from a septic tank into the natural soil.  The centerline depth of the tile is assumed to be 24 inches or deeper.  Only the soil between depths of 24 and 60 inches is considered in making the ratings.  Soil properties and site features considered are those that affect the absorption of the effluent, those that affect the construction and maintenance of the system, and those that may affect public health.

Scope: National

Farm and ranch homesteads, outbuildings, and recreational facilities require a means to safely dispose of effluent.  Septic Tank Absorption Field interpretations are a tool for guiding the user in site selection for safe disposal of household effluent.  The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage to the soil surface, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or flood water.  Potential contamination may be reduced or eliminated by installing systems designed to overcome or reduce the effects of the limiting soil property.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Soil properties and qualities that affect the absorption of the effluent are permeability, depth to a seasonal high water table, depth to bedrock, depth to a cemented pan, and susceptibility to flooding.  Stones and boulders and a shallow depth to bedrock, ice, or a cemented pan interfere with installation.  Subsidence interferes with installation and maintenance.  Excessive slope may cause lateral seepage and surfacing of the effluent in down-slope areas.  In addition, soil erosion is a hazard where absorption fields are installed in steep soils.
 
Some soils are underlain by loose sand and gravel or fractured bedrock at a depth less than 4 feet below the distribution lines.  In these soils, the absorption field may not adequately filter the effluent, particularly when the system is new; consequently, ground water supplies may be contaminated.
 
Percolation tests are used by some regulatory agencies to evaluate the suitability of a soil for septic tank absorption fields.  These tests should be performed during the season when the water table is highest and the soil is at minimum absorptive capacity.

CO643,ENG - Sanitary Landfill (Trench),limitation,"Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as "" Sanitary Landfill (Trench)"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the "" Sanitary Landfill (Trench)"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Sanitary landfill (trench) is a method of disposing solid waste by placing refuse in successive layers in an excavated trench.  The waste is spread, compacted, and covered daily with a thin layer of soil that is excavated from the trench.  When the trench is full, a final cover of soil material at least 2 feet thick is placed over the landfill.

Scope: National

The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or floodwater.  Potential contamination may be reduced or eliminated by installing systems designed to overcome or reduce the effects of the limiting soil property.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Ratings are based on properties and qualities to the depth normally observed during soil mapping (approximately 5 or 6 feet).  However, because trenches may be as deep as 15 feet or more, geologic investigations are needed to determine the potential for pollution of ground water as well as to determine the design needed.  These investigations, which are generally arranged by the landfill developer, include the examination of stratification, rock formations, and geologic conditions that might lead to the conducting of leachates to aquifers, wells, watercourses, and other water sources.  The presence of hard, nonrippable bedrock, bedrock crevices, or highly permeable strata in or immediately underlying the proposed trench bottom is undesirable because of the difficulty in excavation and the potential pollution of underground water.

Properties that influence the risk of pollution, ease of excavation, trafficability, and revegetation are major considerations.  Soils that flood or have a water table within the depth of excavation present a potential pollution hazard and are difficult to excavate.  Slope is an important consideration because it affects the work involved in road construction, the performance of the roads, and the control of surface water around the landfill.  It may also cause difficulty in constructing trenches for which the trench bottom must be kept level and oriented to follow the contour.

The ease with which the trench is dug and with which a soil can be used as daily and final covers is based largely on texture and consistence of the soil.  The texture and consistence of a soil determine the degree of workability of the soil both when dry and when wet.  Soils that are plastic and sticky when wet are difficult to excavate, grade, or compact and difficult to place as a uniformly thick cover over a layer of refuse.  The uppermost part of the final cover should be soil material that is favorable for the growth of plants.  It should not contain excess sodium or salt and should not be too acid.  In comparison with other horizons, the A horizon in most soils has the best workability and the highest content of organic matter.  Thus, for a trench-type landfill operation it may be desirable to stockpile the surface layer for use in the final blanketing of the fill.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

	1.  Depth to thick/thin cemented pan: Depth to thick or thin cemented pan may pose construction limitations or environmental and health risks when landfills are installed.

If pan thickness is < 46cm then the rating is reduced by half.  Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table.

16. Dustiness is a concern for human health as well as aesthetic reasons.  Dust generation from roads is a significant source of inhalable particulate matter.  Two dust particle sizes are recognized: PM10 and PM2.5, relating to particles of aerodynamic diameters of 10 and 2.5 microns, respectively.  The capacity of soils to produce dust particles has been found by Carvacho et al (2004) to be directly related to the clay or silt content of the soil.  Thus, the PM10 or PM2.5 generation capacity of a soil is inversely proportional to its sand content.  Gypsum is also related to dustiness because the soft crystals are relatively easily crushed to silt and clay size particles which can then be picked up by air.

Other major variables in dust generation are moisture content and the amount of working of the soil.

The ""Dryness Index"" accounts for the moisture content of the surface.  In a dry, hot environment, the generation of dust is greater than in a cool, moist environment.  Thus dust generation is directly proportional to temperature and inversely proportional to rainfall.

An array of materials is available for overcoming dust limitations (Gebhart et al, 1999).

CO643,ENG - Sanitary Landfill (Area),limitation,"Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as ""Sanitary Landfill (Area)"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""Sanitary Landfill (Area)"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Sanitary landfill (area) is a solid-waste disposal practice where successive layers of refuse are placed on the soil surface.  The waste is spread, compacted, and covered daily with a thin layer of soil that is imported from a source away from the site.  A final cover of soil at least 2 feet thick is placed over the completed landfill.   Properties and qualities that influence trafficability and risk of pollution are the important considerations for area sanitary landfills.

Scope: National

The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or floodwater.  Potential contamination may be reduced or eliminated by installing systems designed to overcome or reduce the effects of the limiting soil property.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Flooding is a serious problem because of the risk of washouts and pollution downstream and the difficulty of moving trucks in and out of flooded areas.  Permeability of the soil is an important consideration in all but the most arid parts of the country.  If permeability is too rapid or if fractured bedrock or a fractured cemented pan is close to the surface, the risk of contaminating the water supply by leachate is great.  A high water table may also transmit pollutants to the water supply and is likely to restrict truck movement during wet seasons.  

Slope is a consideration because of the extra grading required to maintain roads on sloping soils.  Furthermore, leachate may flow along the soil surface on sloping soils and cause difficult seepage problems in completed fills.

            9.  Dustiness is a concern for human health as well as aesthetic reasons.  Dust generation from roads is a significant source of inhalable particulate matter.  Two dust particle sizes are recognized: PM10 and PM2.5, relating to particles of aerodynamic diameters of 10 and 2.5 microns, respectively.  The capacity of soils to produce dust particles has been found by Carvacho et al (2004) to be directly related to the clay or silt content of the soil.  Thus, the PM10 or PM2.5 generation capacity of a soil is inversely proportional to its sand content.  Gypsum is also related to dustiness because the soft crystals are relatively easily crushed to silt and clay size particles which can then be picked up by air.

Other major variables in dust generation are moisture content and the amount of working of the soil.

The ""Dryness Index"" accounts for the moisture content of the surface.  In a dry, hot environment, the generation of dust is greater than in a cool, moist environment.  Thus dust generation is directly proportional to temperature and inversely proportional to rainfall.

An array of materials is available for overcoming dust limitations (Gebhart et al, 1999).

CO643,ENG - Local Roads and Streets,limitation,"Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Local Roads and Streets"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Local Roads and Streets"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Local roads and streets are those roads and streets that have all-weather surfacing (commonly of asphalt or concrete) and that are expected to carry automobile traffic year-round.

Scope: National

The roads and streets consist of
(1) the underlying local soil material, either cut or fill, which is called ""the sub-grade"";
(2)  the base material, which may be lime-stabilized soil, cement-stabilized soil, gravel, or crushed rock;
(3) the actual road surface or street pavement, which is either flexible (asphalt), rigid (concrete), or gravel with binder in it.
They are graded to shed water, and conventional drainage measures are provided.  With the probable exception of the hard surface, roads and streets are built mainly from the soil at hand.

Soil interpretations for local roads and streets are used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for the practice.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Scope: National

Soil properties and qualities that affect local roads and streets are those that influence the ease of excavation and grading and the traffic-supporting capacity.  The properties and qualities that affect the ease of excavation and grading are hardness of bedrock or a cemented pan, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, depth to a water table, flooding, the amount of large stones, and slope.  The properties that affect traffic-supporting capacity are soil strength as inferred from the AASHTO group index and the Unified classification, subsidence, shrink-swell behavior, potential frost action, and depth to the seasonal high water table.

16.  Roads, pipelines, and structures built on soils containing gypsum are susceptible to damage from differential settling if the soil gypsum should dissolve to due the addition of more water to the soil than can be removed by evapotranspiration.  Subsidence is estimated from the gypsum content of the soil.  Other soluble salts may also contribute to the loss of volume of the soil.  

Assumptions:

* Differential subsidence is assumed to always occur, rather than an equidimensional settling.
* Water as irrigation, leakage, septic systems, or whatever is assumed to be applied.  If no water is added to the soil, no dissolution occurs and therefore no subsidence.
* Dissolution kinetics are assumed to be such that the settling is observable in our lifetimes.
* The size of the structure has an influence on the tolerable amount of distortion due to settling.
* The age of the structure influences the amount of damage it will sustain if differential subsidence occurs.
* The particle size of the gypsum will influence the dissolution rate.  A generic rate is assumed here.

19.  Dustiness is a concern for human health as well as aesthetic reasons.  Dust generation from roads is a significant source of inhalable particulate matter.  Two dust particle sizes are recognized: PM10 and PM2.5, relating to particles of aerodynamic diameters of 10 and 2.5 microns, respectively.  The capacity of soils to produce dust particles has been found by Carvacho et al (2004) to be directly related to the clay or silt content of the soil.  Thus, the PM10 or PM2.5 generation capacity of a soil is inversely proportional to its sand content.  Gypsum is also related to dustiness because the soft crystals are relatively easily crushed to silt and clay size particles which can then be picked up by air.

Other major variables in dust generation are moisture content, time of year, and the amount of working of the soil.

The ""Dryness Index"" accounts for the moisture content of the surface.  In a dry, hot environment, the generation of dust is greater than in a cool, moist environment.  Thus dust generation is directly proportional to temperature and inversely proportional to rainfall.

An array of materials is available for overcoming dust limitations (Gebhart et al, 1999).

CO643,ENG - Dwellings With Basements,limitation,"Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Dwellings With Basements"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Dwellings With Basements"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Dwellings with basements are single-family houses of three stories or less with basements.  The foundation is assumed to be spread footings of reinforced concrete built on undisturbed soil at a depth of about 7 feet.

Scope: National

Soil properties influence the development of building and construction sites, including the selection of the site, the design of the structure, construction, performance, and after construction maintenance.  The soil interpretations for dwellings with basements are used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for the practice.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Ratings are based on soil properties and qualities affecting the capacity of soil to support a load without movement and on those that affect excavation and construction costs.  The properties affecting load-supporting capacity without movement are presence of a seasonal high water table, flooding, and the shrink-swell behavior and compressibility of the soils.  Compressibility is inferred from the Unified classification.  Properties influencing the ease and amount of excavation are flooding, a high water table, slope, depth to bedrock or to a cemented pan, and the amount and size of coarse fragments.

                15.  Subsidence due to gypsum: Roads, pipelines, and structures built on soils containing gypsum are susceptible to damage from differential settling if the soil gypsum should dissolve to due the addition of more water to the soil than can be removed by evapotranspiration.  Subsidence is estimated from the gypsum content of the soil.  Other soluble salts may also contribute to the loss of volume of the soil.  

Assumptions:

* Differential subsidence is assumed to always occur, rather than an equidimensional settling.
* Water as irrigation, leakage, septic systems, or whatever is assumed to be applied.  If no water is added to the soil, no dissolution occurs and therefore no subsidence.
* Dissolution kinetics are assumed to be such that the settling is observable in our lifetimes.
* The size of the structure has an influence on the tolerable amount of distortion due to settling.
* The age of the structure influences the amount of damage it will sustain if differential subsidence occurs.
* The particle size of the gypsum will influence the dissolution rate.  A generic rate is assumed here.

	Property used: COMPONENT LOCAL PHASE

	Null local phase is assigned to the Not limiting class.

15. Roads, pipelines, and structures built on soils containing gypsum are susceptible to damage from differential settling if the soil gypsum should dissolve to due the addition of more water to the soil than can be removed by evapotranspiration.  Subsidence is estimated from the gypsum content of the soil.  Other soluble salts may also contribute to the loss of volume of the soil.  

Assumptions:

* Differential subsidence is assumed to always occur, rather than an equidimensional settling.
* Water as irrigation, leakage, septic systems, or whatever is assumed to be applied.  If no water is added to the soil, no dissolution occurs and therefore no subsidence.
* Dissolution kinetics are assumed to be such that the settling is observable in our lifetimes.
* The size of the structure has an influence on the tolerable amount of distortion due to settling.
* The age of the structure influences the amount of damage it will sustain if differential subsidence occurs.
* The particle size of the gypsum will influence the dissolution rate.  A generic rate is assumed here.

CO643,ENG - Daily Cover for Landfill,limitation,"Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as ""Daily Cover for Landfill"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""Daily Cover for Landfill"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Daily cover for landfill is the soil material that is applied daily to compacted solid waste in a sanitary landfill.  The cover material is obtained offsite, transported, and spread on the area.  The required soil characteristics for both daily and final cover materials are similar enough to share one rating.

Scope: National

Soil interpretations for Daily Cover for Landfills are a tool for guiding the user in barrow site selection and has additional application for the reclamation of some quarries, pits, and surface mine operations.  The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  The ratings are for soils in their present condition and do not consider present land use.

Suitability of a soil for use as cover is based on properties that reflect workability and the ease of digging and of moving and spreading the material over the refuse daily during both wet and dry periods.  Soils that are loamy or silty and that are free of stones are better suited than other soils.  Clayey soils may be sticky and difficult to spread, and sandy soils may be subject to soil blowing.  Slope affects the ease of excavation and of moving the cover material.  It also may affect the final configuration of the borrow area and, thus, runoff, erosion, and reclamation.

The soils selected for daily cover for landfill should also be suitable for growing plants.  They should not contain significant amounts of substances that are toxic to plants, such as a high content of sodium, salts, or lime.  They should be thick enough over bedrock, a cemented pan, or the water table so that material can be removed efficiently while leaving a borrow area that can be revegetated.  However, some damage to the borrow area is expected and plant growth may not be optimum.

18.  Dustiness is a concern for human health as well as aesthetic reasons.  Dust generation from roads is a significant source of inhalable particulate matter.  Two dust particle sizes are recognized: PM10 and PM2.5, relating to particles of aerodynamic diameters of 10 and 2.5 microns, respectively.  The capacity of soils to produce dust particles has been found by Carvacho et al (2004) to be directly related to the clay or silt content of the soil.  Thus, the PM10 or PM2.5 generation capacity of a soil is inversely proportional to its sand content.  Gypsum is also related to dustiness because the soft crystals are relatively easily crushed to silt and clay size particles which can then be picked up by air.

Other major variables in dust generation are moisture content, vehicle size, time of year, and the amount of working of the soil.

The ""Dryness Index"" accounts for the moisture content of the surface.  In a dry, hot environment, the generation of dust is greater than in a cool, moist environment.  Thus dust generation is directly proportional to temperature and inversely proportional to rainfall.

An array of materials is available for overcoming dust limitations (Gebhart et al, 1999).

CO643,ENG - Construction Materials; Topsoil,suitability,"Summary:

Soil survey interpretations for construction materials are made to provide guidance to users in selecting the site of a potential source.  Soils may be selected as potential source materials because they are nearby, are the only source available, or meets some or all of the physical or chemical properties required for the intended application.  In theory, every soil may be used as source materials, but in reality, only a few soils have the profile characteristics that meet the defined criteria and performance requirements when rated for a specific propose.  The use of rating guides can provide the user a means to select potential sites for further evaluation.

Suitability ratings and associated restrictive features are for roadfill, topsoil, sand, gravel, and soil reconstruction material.  The ratings do not consider the quality of the source material because quality depends on how the source material is to be used.  Final site evaluation and selection require an onsite inspection to determine the suitability and quality of the materials for the intended purpose.  Implementation of these interpretations helps minimize the need for excessive random exploratory investigation by pinpointing potential sites.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are suited as a source of ""Topsoil"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property contributes to the soil's potential as a source of topsoil.  The soil property contributing lest is identified as the soil feature making this soil a less then a desirable source of topsoil.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the minimum membership indices of the soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Topsoil"" interpretive rule.

Soils are placed into suitability rating classes per their rating indices.  These are poor (rating index = 0), fair (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or good (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

The term ""topsoil"" has several meanings.  As used here, the term describes soil material used to cover an area and improve soil conditions for the establishment and maintenance of adapted vegetation. 

Generally, the upper part of the soil, which is richest in organic matter, is most desirable for use as topsoil; however, material excavated from deeper layers is also used.  In this rating, the upper 40 inches of soil material is evaluated for use as topsoil.  In the borrow area, the material below 40 inches is evaluated for its suitability for plant growth after the upper 40 inches is removed.

Scope: National

Soil properties that are used to rate the soil as topsoil are those that affect plant growth; the ease of excavation, loading, and spreading; and the reclamation of the borrow area.

The physical and chemical soil properties and qualities that influence plant growth are the presence of toxic substances, soil reaction, and those properties that are inferred from the soil texture, such as the available water capacity and fertility.  The properties that influence the ease of excavation, loading, and spreading are the amount of rock fragments, slope, depth to the water table, soil texture, and thickness of suitable material.  The properties that influence the reclamation of the borrow area are the slope, depth to the water table, amount of rock fragments, depth to rock, and the presence of toxic material.

                        16.  Aluminum saturation -- Some agricultural crops suffer from aluminum toxicity when the Al saturation is only 10%. Aluminum interferes with the photosynthetic cycle by complexing with phosphate, so with high soluble aluminum the plant is starved for phosphate. Al-toxicity also stunts root growth thereby limiting the amount of soil the plant can exploit for nutrients. Stunted roots can also limit water uptake and can cause plants to wilt with only a few days without water. Some plants (e.g. cassava) have high tolerance to high levels of soluble aluminum. High soluble Al and acidity may adversely affect soil health by inhibiting beneficial organisms. When liming soils with high soluble aluminum the rule of thumb is to add 1.5 tons of CaCO3 per acre for every milliequivalents of soluble aluminum. The pH only needs to be raised to about 5.5 to eliminate the harmful effects of high soluble aluminum. (Source: Dr. Robert Gavenda, PhD; PowerPoint presentation on soil degradation)

About one-third of the tropics (1.5 billion hectares) has sufficiently strong soil acidity for soluble aluminum to be toxic to most crop species. This constraint is defined as having more than 60% Al saturation in some part of the top 50 cm of soil. A soil pH value of less than 5.5 usually indicates this problem (Evans and Kamprath, 1970). Aluminum toxicity is most prevalent in the humid tropics and acid savannas. This constraint is found mainly in soils classified as oxisols, ultisols and closely related inceptisols and is correlated with low nutrient capital reserves. Aluminum toxicity is usually the overwhelming constraint in these soils and must be tackled first, either by modern lime application practices, by using Al-tolerant plant species or by breeding for Al-tolerant varieties (Sanchez and Salinas, 1981). It is relevant to note that aluminum toxicity is rare in most smallholder farming areas of subhumid and semiarid Africa, except for parts of Rwanda, Burundi, Northern Zambia, Southern Congo, KwaZulu Natal Province in South Africa and in some sandy soils of Zimbabwe (Sanchez et al., 1997). Two-thirds of the tropics does not have enough aluminum saturation to worry about. Aluminum toxicity can become a positive soil quality attribute when using Al-tolerant plants in P-deficient soils. The low pH facilitates the dissolution of phosphate rocks, letting, in effect, the H+ ions in the soil do what a superphosphate factory doestreating rock phosphates with acids (Sanchez and Salinas, 1981). High aluminum saturation, as defined by this modifier, is also a positive attribute for rubber and tea production (Smith, 1989).

17.  Exchange capacity -- Some soils lack the ability to retain cations.  Application of liming materials and other fertilizers must be more frequent to maintain the intended vegetation.  Cation exchange capacity (CEC) is the measure of how well a soil can retain cations, such as calcium, magnesium, and potassium.  CEC is measured in milliequivalents (meq) per 100 grams soil.  Here a capacity is used and the measurement is milliequivalents per unit volume soil in the rooting depth or to 100cm.  In soils having pH less than 5.5, effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC) is reported.

18.   Liquefaction -- Some soils can hold so much water that they lose strength under stress and can flow as a liquid.  This condition is indicated by a Unified Classification of OH-T.  This is a proposed classification for some volcanic soils found on the islands in the Pacific, although the condition could exist elsewhere as well.  This should not be confused with seismically-induced liquefaction, although these soils would be affected by a siesmic event.

19.  Too acid -- In some areas, such as the Pacific Basin, where liming materials are scarce, low pH can render soil material unsuitable for use as topsoil.  If the pH is below 5.5 and the soil is well buffered, the amount of lime needed to raise the pH to levels where plants can grow may be prohibitive.

CO643,ENG - Construction Materials; Sand Source,suitability,"Summary:

Soil survey interpretations for construction materials are made to provide guidance to users in selecting the site of a potential source.  Soils may be selected as potential source materials because they are nearby, are the only source available, or meets some or all of the physical or chemical properties required for the intended application.  In theory, every soil may be used as source materials, but in reality, only a few soils have the profile characteristics that meet the defined criteria and performance requirements when rated for a specific propose.  The use of rating guides can provide the user a means to select potential sites for further evaluation.

Suitability ratings and associated restrictive features are for roadfill, topsoil, sand, gravel, and soil reconstruction material.  The ratings do not consider the quality of the source material because quality depends on how the source material is to be used.  Final site evaluation and selection require an onsite inspection to determine the suitability and quality of the materials for the intended purpose.  Implementation of these interpretations helps minimize the need for excessive random exploratory investigation by pinpointing potential sites.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are suited as a ""Sand Source"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property contributes to the soils potential as a source of sand.  The soil property contributing lest is identified as the soil feature making this soil a less then desirable source of sand.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the minimum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Sand Source "" interpretive rule.  

Soils are placed into suitability rating classes per their rating indices.  These are poor (rating index = 0), fair (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or good (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Sand as a construction material is usually defined as particles ranging in size from 0.074 mm (sieve #200) to 4.75 mm (sieve #4) in diameter.  Sand is used in great quantities in many kinds of construction.  Specifications for each purpose vary widely.  The intent of this rating is to show only the probability of finding material in suitable quantity.  The suitability of the sand for specific purposes is not evaluated.

Soil properties influence selection of a site as a potential source of sand.  The soil interpretation for sand source is used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability or identifying the soil limitations as a potential source.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Scope: National

The properties used to evaluate the soils as a probable source of sand are the grain size as indicated by the Unified soil classification, the thickness of the sand layer, and the amount of rock fragments in the soil material.  They are listed in Table 620-8.  If the lowest layer of the soil contains sand, the soil is rated as a probable source regardless of thickness.  The assumption is that the sand layer below the depth of observation exceeds the minimum thickness.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most suited of the following soil features.

	1.  Content of organic matter: Soil in Unified class pt is high in organic materials and not a good source of construction materials.  Soil feature considered is the rv or first Unified class of all soil layers.

	3.  Bottom layer: If the bottom layer contains significant amounts of material that passes the #4 sieve and not the #200 sieve, and does not contain rocks or coarse fragments, then the bottom layer is a potential source for sand.

In theory, every soil may be used as source materials, but in reality, only a few soils have the profile characteristics that meet the defined criteria and performance requirements when rated for a specific propose.  The use of rating guides can provide the user a means to select potential sites for further evaluation.

Suitability ratings and associated restrictive features are for roadfill, topsoil, sand, gravel, and soil reconstruction material.  The ratings do not consider the quality of the source material because quality depends on how the source material is to be used.  Final site evaluation and selection require an onsite inspection to determine the suitability and quality of the materials for the intended purpose.  Implementation of these interpretations helps minimize the need for excessive random exploratory investigation by pinpointing potential sites.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are suited as a source of ""Roadfill"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property contributes to the soil's potential as a source of roadfill.  The soil property contributing lest is identified as the soil feature making this soil a less then a desirable source of roadfill.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the minimum membership indices of the soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Roadfill"" interpretive rule.

Soils are placed into suitability rating classes per their rating indices.  These are poor (rating index = 0), fair (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or good (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Roadfill consists of soil material that is excavated from its original position and used in road embankments elsewhere.  The evaluations for roadfill are for low embankments that generally are less than 6 feet in height and are less exacting in design than high embankments, such as those along superhighways.  The rating is given for the whole soil, from the surface to a depth of about 5 feet, based on the assumption that soil horizons will be mixed in loading, dumping, and spreading.  In Table 620-7 criteria, limits, and restrictive features for rating soils for local roads and streets are given.  Soils are rated as to the amount of material available for excavation, the ease of excavation, and how well the material performs after it is in place.

Scope: National

Soil properties that affect the amount of material available for excavation are thickness of suitable material above bedrock or other material that is not suitable.  The percent of coarse fragments more than 3 inches in diameter, the depth to a seasonal high water table, and the slope are properties that influence the ease of excavation.  How well the soil performs in place is indicated by the AASHTO classification and group index and by the shrink-swell potential.  A high content of gypsum can cause piping or pitting.  Some damage to the borrow area is expected; but if revegetation and erosion control are likely to be difficult, the soil is rated severe.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most suited of the following soil features.

	1.  Cobble content: Excessive cobbles (rock fragments, 3 to 10 inches in size) in the upper 40 inches (100 cm) of the soil can interfere with construction equipment and grade stabilization.

	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.

10.  Gypsum content -- Roads, pipelines, and structures built on soils containing gypsum are susceptible to damage from differential settling if the gypsum should dissolve to due the addition of water to the soil.  Subsidence is estimated from the gypsum content of the soil.  Other soluble salts may also contribute to the loss of volume of the soil.  

Assumptions:

* Differential subsidence is assumed to always occur, rather than an equidimensional settling.
* Water as irrigation, leakage, septic systems, or whatever is assumed to be applied.  If no water is added to the soil, no dissolution occurs and therfore no subsidence.
* Dissolution kinetics are assumed to be such that the settling is observable in our lifetimes.
* The size of the structure has an influence on the tolerable amount of distortion due to settling.
* The age of the structure influences the amount of damage it will sustain if differential subsidence occurs.
* The particle size of the gypsum will influence the dissolution rate.  A generic rate is assumed here.

11. Dustiness is a concern for human health as well as aesthetic reasons.  Dust generation from roads is a significant source of inhalable particulate matter.  Two dust particle sizes are recognized: PM10 and PM2.5, relating to particles of aerodynamic diameters of 10 and 2.5 microns, respectively.  The capacity of soils to produce dust particles has been found by Carvacho et al (2004) to be directly related to the clay or silt content of the soil.  Thus, the PM10 or PM2.5 generation capacity of a soil is inversely proportional to its sand content.

Other major variables in dust generation are moisture content, vehicle size, and the amount of traffic on the road.

The ""Dryness Index"" accounts for the moisture content of the surface.  In a dry, hot environment, the generation of dust is less than in a cool, moist environment.  Thus dust generation is directly proportional to temperature and inversely proportional to rainfall.

An array of materials is available for overcoming dust limitations (Gebhart et al, 1999).

12.  Liquefaction -- Some soils can hold so much water that they lose strength under stress and can flow as a liquid.  This condition is indicated by a Unified Classification of OH-T.  This is a proposed classification for some volcanic soils found on the islands in the Pacific, although the condition could exist elsewhere as well.  This should not be confused with seismically-induced liquefaction, although these soils would be affected by a siesmic event.

The overall interpretive rating assigned is the minimum membership indices of the soil interpretive property that comprise the "" Reclamation"" interpretive rule.  

Soils are placed into suitability rating classes per their rating indices.  These are poor (rating index = 0), fair (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or good (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Soil reconstruction of areas drastically disturbed, as in surface mining, is the process of replacing layers of soil material or unconsolidated geologic material, or both, in a vertical sequence of such quality and thickness that a favorable medium for plant growth is provided.

Most new state strip mine programs emphasize that the land surface be restored to about its natural configuration or better and that the soil be reconstructed to maintain or improve its suitability for the intended use.  Thus, knowledge of the soil and underlying material is needed to plan proper reconstruction operations of mined land.  This guide for soil reconstruction material evaluates the material as a medium for plant growth.  This guide does not cover areas of quarry, pit, dredge, and older surface mine operations that require an offsite source of soil reconstruction material.

When the soil materials are properly used in reconstruction, a rating of good means that vegetation is relatively easy to establish and maintain, that the surface is stable and resists erosion, and that the reconstructed soil has good potential productivity.  Material rated fair can be vegetated and stabilized by modifying one or more properties.  Topdressing with better material or applications of soil amendments may be necessary for satisfactory performance.  Material rated poor has such severe problems that revegetation and stabilization are very difficult and costly.  Topdressing with better material is necessary to establish and maintain vegetation.

Soil properties influence selection of a site as a potential source of reconstruction material.  The soil interpretation for reconstruction material source is used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability or identifying the soil limitations as a potential source.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Scope: National

Vegetation is difficult to establish on soils that have high pH.  Many of these soils also have a high sodium adsorption ratio, which indicates potential instability and water transmission problems.  Materials that are extremely acid or have the potential upon oxidation of becoming extremely acid are difficult and expensive to vegetate.  They also contribute to poor water quality, in runoff or in ground water.

The available water capacity also is important in establishing vegetation.  Soils that have a low available water capacity may require irrigation for the establishment of vegetation.

The stability of the soil depends upon its erodibility by water and wind and its strength.  Water erodibility is indicated by the K factor; wind erodibility is rated according to the ""I"" value of the wind erodibility group.  Potential slippage hazard is related to soil texture, and although other factors also contribute, the ratings of soil texture represent one important factor.

The fraction 3-10 inches is a weight percentage of rock fragments in the material used for soil reconstruction.  The amount and size of rock fragments influence the ease of excavation, stockpiling, and respreading and the suitability for the final use of the land.  A certain amount of rock fragments can be tolerated depending upon their size and the intended use of the reclaimed area.  If the size of rock fragments exceeds 10 inches, problems are more severe.

Soils are placed into suitability rating classes per their rating indices.  These are poor (rating index = 0), fair (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or good (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Gravel as a construction material is defined as particles ranging in size from 4.76 mm (sieve #4) to 76 mm (3 inches) in diameter.  Gravel is used in great quantities in many kinds of construction.  Specifications for each purpose vary widely.  The intent of this rating is to show only the probability of finding material in suitable quantity.  The suitability of the gravel for specific purposes is not evaluated.

Soil properties influence selection of a site as a potential source of gravel.  The soil interpretation for gravel source is used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability or identifying the soil limitations as a potential source.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Scope: National

The properties used to evaluate the soil as a probable source of gravel are grain size as indicated by the Unified soil classification, the thickness of the gravel layer, and the amount of rock fragments in the soil material.  If the lowest layer of the soil contains gravel, the soil is rated as a probable source regardless of thickness.  The assumption is that the gravel layer below the depth of observation exceeds the minimum thickness.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most suited of the following soil features.

	1.  Bottom layer: If the bottom layer contains significant amounts of material that passes the #4 sieve and not the #200 sieve, and does not contain rocks or coarse fragments, then the bottom layer is a potential source for sand.  The bottom layer takes precedence over the thickest layer.   There is no layer thickness restriction on the bottom layer.  The following child rules are joined by the AND operator and the one with the lowest index number determine the interpretive result.

CO643,DHS - Suitability for Composting Medium and Final Cover,suitability,"Summary:

Soil survey interpretations for composting medium and final cover materials are made to provide guidance to users in selecting the site of a potential source.  Soils may be selected as potential source materials because they are nearby, are the only source available, or meet some or all of the physical or chemical properties required for the intended application.  In theory, every soil may be used as source materials, but in reality, only a few soils have the profile characteristics that meet the defined criteria and performance requirements when rated for a specific propose.  The use of rating guides can provide the user a means to select potential sites for further evaluation.  Final site evaluation and selection require an onsite inspection to determine the suitability and quality of the materials for the intended purpose.  Implementation of these interpretations helps minimize the need for excessive random exploratory investigation by pinpointing potential sites.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are suited as a source of ""Composting Medium and Final Cover"".  If a soil's property within 200 cm of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property contributes to the soil's potential as a source of composting medium or final cover.  The soil property contributing the least is identified as the soil feature making this soil a less than a desirable source of composting medium or final cover.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the minimum membership indices of the soil interpretive property that comprise the ""DHS - Composting Medium and Final Cover"" interpretive rule.

Soils are placed into suitability rating classes per their rating indices.  These are poor (rating index = 0), fair (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or good (rating index = 1.0).

Description:


Generally, the upper part of the soil, which is richest in organic matter, is most desirable for use as medium or cover material; however, material excavated from deeper layers is also used.  In this rating, the upper 100cm of soil material is evaluated for use as topsoil.  In the borrow area, the material below 100cm inches is evaluated for its suitability for plant growth after the upper 100cm is removed.

Scope: National

Soil properties that are used to rate the soil as a composting medium and final cover material are those that affect plant growth; the ease of excavation, loading, and spreading; and the reclamation of the borrow area.

The physical and chemical soil properties and qualities that influence plant growth are the presence of toxic substances, soil reaction, and those properties that are inferred from the soil texture, such as the available water capacity and fertility.  The properties that influence the ease of excavation, loading, and spreading are the amount of rock fragments, slope, depth to the water table, soil texture, and thickness of suitable material.  The properties that influence the reclamation of the borrow area are the slope, depth to the water table, amount of rock fragments, depth to rock, and the presence of toxic material.  The presence of even a small percentage of rock fragments in excess of 4.7mm is detrimental to the desirability of the compost material produced.

CO643,DHS - Suitability for Clay Liner Material,suitability,"Clay Liner for Waste Disposal				

Clay Liner for Waste Disposal is a constructed geologic barrier used to confine and isolate solid and liquid waste in disposal sites where protection of soil, ground water, and surface water is important.  The primary objective of the geologic barrier is to control leachate and gas migration.  Flexible membranes and drainage layers may be used with clay liner for waste disposal.  In some situations, bentonite is added to soils low in clay to achieve the desired hydraulic conductivity.

This interpretation rates potential sites for sources of clay liner material.  The primary assumption for clay liner for waste disposal is that the hydraulic conductivity of soils or geologic materials in the foundation of the waste disposal site is too high and leachate and gases from the buried waste can migrate into the soil, ground water, or surface water.  It is assumed that the source clay liner material would be a minimum of 50 cm thick before it would be feasible to excavate.  The material should be free of large rock fragments, roots, or other debris since it would be difficult to screen such clayey material to separate undesirable components.  Once it is excavated, it would be transported to the waste disposal site and it would be placed directly into the trench.  Water would be added if needed for appropriate compaction.  Bentonite would be added to the clay liner material at this time also, if needed. 

Scope: National

The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water through seepage or migration of gases.  Potential contamination may be reduced or eliminated by installing systems designed to overcome or reduce the effects of the limiting soil property, such as the use of a flexible membrane, drainage layers, or increased thickness of the geologic barrier.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Ratings are based on properties and qualities to the depth normally observed during soil mapping (approximately 6 feet).  However, because excavations may be as deep as 15 feet or more, geologic investigations are needed to determine the potential for pollution of ground water as well as to determine the design needed.  These investigations include the examination of stratification, rock formations, and geologic conditions that might lead to the conducting of leachates or migration of gases to aquifers, wells, watercourses, and other water sources.  The presence of rough bedrock, bedrock crevices, or highly permeable strata in or immediately underlying the proposed pit bottom is undesirable because of the difficulty in getting an adequate seal at the boundary of the rock and the Clay Liner material that would adequately reduce the potential pollution of underground water.

Soil properties that influence the risk of pollution and the ease of excavation and installation or compaction are major considerations.  Soils that have a water table within the depth of excavation present a potential pollution hazard and are difficult to excavate.  Slope is an important consideration because it affects the work involved in installing the liner.  It may also cause difficulty in constructing trenches for which the trench bottom must be kept level and oriented to follow the contour.

The ease with which the clay liner material is dug and placed is based largely on texture and consistence of the soil.  The texture and consistence of a soil also determine the degree of workability of the soil both when dry and when wet.  Soils that are plastic and sticky when wet are difficult to excavate, grade, or compact.  The Plasticity Index and the mineralogy of the soil help define the consistency of the soil.  

See the Daily Cover for Waste Disposal, Large-scale Event national soil interpretation to determine if suitable soils materials are available for the final cover of the site.  It may be desirable to stockpile the surface soil layer in the Clay Liner borrow area for use in the final blanketing of the fill.

The minimum requirements for the geologic barrier are as follows:

Landfill for hazardous waste - Ksat 10-9 m/sec  thickness  5 m
Landfill for non-hazardous waste - Ksat 10-9 m/sec  thickness  1 m
Landfill for inert waste - Ksat 10-7 m/sec  thickness  1 m
(Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Subtitle B - Ksat 10-7 cm/sec  thickness  2 ft, flexible membrane at least 60 mil (1.5 mm)).
(EPA - 3 ft soil layer) 

Criteria:
1.	Soil shall be free of roots, debris, organic or frozen material.
2.	Soil shall have a maximum clod size of 50 mm (2 in) at the time of compaction.
3.	Soil max. particle size  25 mm
(12.5 mm if flexible membrane is used)*
4.	Soil min. percent passing 4.75 mm sieve  80
5.	Soil min. percent passing 0.075 mm sieve  50
6.	Soil min. liquid limit  35
7.	Soil min. plasticity index  10
8.	Soil max. plasticity index  40

These criteria were determined based on information from the following references:

*In the NASIS database, no size breaks easily equivalent to these sizes are used.  There is no break between 4.76 (number 4 sieve) and 75 mm.  It was thought that basing the rating on the material passing the Number 4 sieve would be too restrictive so the 75 mm size is used to approximate the 25 mm.  As a concession, the amount of >75mm material allowed is kept very low (5 percent).



Criteria Used:


1.  Area reclaim:  Soil reconstruction of areas drastically disturbed, as in obtaining material for a clay liner, is the process of replacing layers of soil material or unconsolidated geologic material, or both, in a vertical sequence of such quality and thickness that a favorable medium for plant growth is provided.

When the soil materials are properly used in reconstruction, a rating of good means that vegetation is relatively easy to establish and maintain, that the surface is stable and resists erosion, and that the reconstructed soil has good potential productivity.  Material rated fair can be vegetated and stabilized by modifying one or more properties.  Topdressing with better material or applications of soil amendments may be necessary for satisfactory performance.  Material rated poor has such severe problems that revegetation and stabilization are very difficult and costly.  Topdressing with better material is necessary to establish and maintain vegetation.

Soil properties influence selection of a site as a potential source of reconstruction material.  The soil interpretation for reconstruction material source is used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability or identifying the soil limitations as a potential source.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Vegetation is difficult to establish on soils that have high pH.  Many of these soils also have a high sodium adsorption ratio, which indicates potential instability and water transmission problems.  Materials that are extremely acid or have the potential upon oxidation of becoming extremely acid are difficult and expensive to vegetate.  They also contribute to poor water quality, in runoff or in ground water.

The available water capacity also is important in establishing vegetation.  Soils that have a low available water capacity may require irrigation for the establishment of vegetation.

The stability of the soil depends upon its erodibility by water and wind and its strength.  Water erodibility is indicated by the K factor; wind erodibility is rated according to the ""I"" value of the wind erodibility group.  Potential slippage hazard is related to soil texture, and although other factors also contribute, the ratings of soil texture represent one important factor.

The fraction 3-10 inches is a weight percentage of rock fragments in the material used for soil reconstruction.  The amount and size of rock fragments influence the ease of excavation, stockpiling, and respreading and the suitability for the final use of the land.  A certain amount of rock fragments can be tolerated depending upon their size and the intended use of the reclaimed area.  If the size of rock fragments exceeds 10 inches, problems are more severe.

Flood waters can transport material away from the site and can deposit unwanted material on the site.  If the number of months a soil component has frequent or occasional flooding falls within the following parameters then the rule returns a value less than 1 and flooding is a limiting feature:

Flooding Frequency	Months
------------------	------
Frequent		>0

6.  Hard to pack:  The amount of soil material passing the number 200 sieve, the liquid limit, and the plasticity index of soil material relates to its compactability.  Optimally, the material used for a clay liner should be readily compacted to a layer having low water transmission capabilities. 


These three soil characteristics are examined.  The least favorable of the three determines the soil's desirability as material for a clay liner.

	1.  Property evaluated: 200 SIEVE 30-200cm OR ABOVE RESTRICTIVE LAYER WTD_AVE (Modality - high, low, and representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:

		Somewhat suited 	> 35 to <= 60 percent
		Well suited		> 60 percent
		
	Null liquid limit is assigned to the Not rated class.

		Well suited		 > 170 cm
		
	Null Component Restriction is assigned to the well suited class.
	
	
	
8.  Compactable material:  The amount of soil material passing the number 4 sieve relates to its compactability.  Optimally, the material used for a clay liner should be readily compacted to a layer having low water transmission capabilities.  The weighted average of the material bewtween 30 and 200 cm is examined.  The weighted average is used because it is assumed the material will be subjected to at least a small amount of stirring during processing.

Ponding Frequency	Months
-----------------	------
Frequent		>0
Occasional		>2


10.  Rock fragments:  The rock fragment content of a soil influences its usefulness as material for a clay liner.  Rock fragments decrease the compactability and provide planes of weakness for water flow.  Also, they may pucture the plastic liner if one is used.  Optimally, the material used for a clay liner should be free of rock fragments greater than 2.5 cm in diameter.  This rule keys on rock fragments in the 3 to 10 inch range.

	Null rock fragments 3 to 10 and rock > 10 are assigned to the Not rated class.
	
	
	
11.  Slope:  The slope of the soil surface influences its trafficability for equipment and also can cause erosion hazard if steep.

	Property evaluated: SLOPE (Modality - high, low, and representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Poorly suited		> 8 percent  
		Somewhat suited 	<= 8 to 3 percent
		Well suited		< 3 percent
		
	Null slopes are assigned to the Not rated class.

Background

Composting: The Process of Biological Degradation

Biological degradation of organic materials forms the basis for composting.  This biological process depends on the active metabolism of microorganisms in a suitable micro-environment. The six critical factors for the transformation of organic materials into compost are microorganisms, heat, air, water, carbon, and nitrogen.

The microorganisms that carry out biological degradation for composting often are found in the soil or on the surface of leaves.  These microorganisms thrive in a surface or subsurface microclimate with free circulation of air, free flow of water, and a temperature well above freezing. The microorganisms also require carbon as food for energy and growth, as well as nitrogen for protein and rebuilding cells.

Composting facilities are designed to provide these six critical factors in relative proportions so that the process of biological degradation is sustained.  Deficits in any of the critical factors, or imbalances among them, may result in extremely slow composting or a dormant composting system. Mixing of materials also redistributes heat, air, and water and will speed the process of biological degradation. Large facilities may provide mechanical mixing of the compost materials. Smaller facilities may rely on manual turning of the materials or may add some materials that are too large to compost in order to create channels for air flow through the pile. 

Mean Annual Precipitation (MAP) and Mean Annual Air Temperature (MAAT) are measures of the soil micro-climate that affects the rate of composting.  Both MAP and MAAT are available from the soil survey database.  Composting is most rapid in warm, moist areas that generally have MAP between 450 and 1250 mm together with MAAT between 5 and 10 degrees Celsius.  The optimal temperature inside the compost pile is 10 to 15.5 degrees Celsius. In colder areas the rate of composting may be increased by insulating the compost pile on all sides with an extra layer of high carbon materials such as hay or newspaper. To avoid extreme cold or rainforest conditions, the composting may be done inside a protected area or a building.  The optimal moisture for composting is field capacity, or freely drained but moist. Moisture may need to be added to the compost pile especially if the organic materials are dry such as chipped lumber. 

The ratio of carbon to nitrogen in the organic materials is perhaps the hardest part of the process to regulate.  Active compost piles need a carbon to nitrogen ratio of about 30:1 (30 units of carbon to 1 unit of nitrogen). Many common materials such as leaves and lumber are high in carbon and require balanced inputs of materials that are high in nitrogen such as coffee grounds or manures and urines.  Often the materials high in nitrogen are less available or more difficult to transport to the composting site. Materials intended for composting may vary in their carbon to nitrogen ratio due to many factors and testing of materials is recommended before large scale operations begin. A few C:N examples are given in table 1.

Publications (with estimated ratios of carbon to nitrogen)

If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""Site for Composting Facility"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Site for composting facility is the site location for placement of a composting facility without the use of a liner or placement on concrete pad. The composting facility is to process raw manure or other raw organic by-products into biologically stable organic material as outlined in the NRCS conservation practice standard ""Composting Facility"" (code 317). 

Scope: National

The bottom elevation of the composting facility shall be above the seasonal high water table and on soils with an acceptable permeability that does not allow materials to contaminate the ground water. Compost facilities should be located outside of floodplains.  However, if site restrictions require location within a floodplain, they shall be protected from inundation or damage from a 25-year flood event, or larger. Locate compost facilities so prevailing winds and landscape elements such as building arrangement, landforms and vegetation minimize odors and protect the visual resource. Direct any contaminated runoff from compost facilities to an appropriate storage or treatment facility for further management.

Suitability of a soil for use as a site for composting should be on soils with an acceptable permeability that does not allow materials to contaminate the ground water. Slope affects the ease of accessing and manipulating the compost material.  It also will affect runoff from the site. If slope is limiting, then consult the ""Site for Composting Facility  Subsurface"" interpretation.


Soil interpretations for locating a site for composting are used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for the practice.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.


Criteria used:


1.  Depth to saturated zone: Shallow depth to water table limits the site for use as a composting facility.  Soils that are shallow to water are also difficult to reclaim and revegetate, and contamination from leaching may create health and environmental hazards.  Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first layer where soil moisture layer status is wet or saturated during any month.

	Property used: HIGH WATER TABLE DEPTH MINIMUM (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		 < 100 cm
		Somewhat limiting	=> 100 to =< 200 cm
		Not limiting		 > 200 cm
		
	Null depth to saturation is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	
2.  Flooding:  If the number of months a soil component has frequent or occasional flooding falls within the following parameters then the rule returns a value greater than 0 and flooding is a limiting feature:

Flooding Frequency	Months
------------------	------
Frequent		>0
Occasional		>2


3.  Fragments in soil:  Large stone impede the workability of the soil and restrict trafficability of heavy machinery and site reclamation.  Soil feature considered is percent by weight rock fragments > 10 inches in size in the surface soil layer.



	Property evaluated: WTD_AVG FRAGS > 250mm 0-30cm OR ABOVE RESTRICTION (Modality - high, low, and representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Poorly suited		 > 15 percent
		Somewhat suited 	=> 5 to 15 percent
		Well suited		 < 5 percent
		
	Null surface fragment coverage is assigned to the ""not rated"" class.	



4.  Surface fragments:  Soils that have large fragments on the surface have reduced trafficability.  The large rock fragments on the surface must be removed.  Rock fragment coverage criteria are as follows.


	Property evaluated: FRAGMENTS >=250MM ON THE SURFACE  (Modality - high, low, and representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Poorly suited		 > 15 percent
		Somewhat suited 	=> 3 to 15 percent
		Well suited		 < 3 percent
		
	Null surface fragment coverage is assigned to the Well suited class.



5.  Seepage:  The soil horizon with the maximum Ksat governs the leaching and seepage potential of the soil.   When this rate is high, transmission of fluids into and through the soil is unimpeded and leaching and seepage may become an environmental, health, and performance concern.  Soil feature considered is the layer with the maximum Ksat within a depth of 200cm.

            Property used: KSAT HIGHEST MINIMUM, 0-200CM OR FIRST RESTRICTION (Modality - high, low, representative value)

            Restriction limits:
                    Limiting                 	> 42.0 micrometers/sec
                    Somewhat Limiting       	 > 14.1 and <= 42.0 micrometers/sec
                    Not limiting           	 =< 14.1 micrometers/sec

            Null Ksat values are assigned to the ""Not rated"" class.


6.  Depth to permafrost: Permafrost (permanently frozen soil layer) restricts or effects excavation, manipulation, transport, stability, and workability of the soil material.  Soil features considered are restrictive feature depth and where kind is permafrost or USDA TEXTURE (IN-LIEU-OF) is ""cpf"" or USDA TEXTURE MODIFIER is ""pf"".
	
	Property used: DEPTH TO PERMAFROST (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		 < 50cm
		Somewhat limiting 	=> 50 to =< 100cm
		Not limiting		 > 100cm
		
	Null depths are assigned  to the Not limiting class.
OR
		
	Property used: USDA TEXTURE (IN-LIEU-OF) (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting	= ""cpf""
		Not limiting	not = ""cpf""
		
	Null USDA Texture (In-Lieu-Of) are assigned to the Not limiting class.
OR
		
	Property used: USDA TEXTURE MODIFIER (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting	= ""pf""
		Not limiting	not = ""pf""
		
	Null USDA Texture Modifier are assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	
	
7.  Ponding:  If the number of months a soil component has frequent or occasional ponding falls within the following parameters then the rule returns a value greater than 0 and ponding is a limiting feature:

Ponding Frequency	Months
-----------------	------
Frequent		>0
Occasional		>2



8.  Mean annual precipitation: Localities that have low rainfall are limited for use as composting facilities.  In places that have low rainfall, moisture will need to be added to maintain biological activity in the composting mass.  The site feature considered is mean annual precipitation.

	Property used: PRECIPITATION (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		 < 400 mm
		Somewhat limiting	=> 400-1200 mm
		Not limiting		 > 1200 mm
		
	Null precipitation is assigned to the ""Not rated"" class.
	
	
	
9.  Slope:  The slope of the soil surface influences its trafficability for equipment and also can cause erosion hazard if steep.

	Property evaluated: SLOPE (Modality - high, low, and representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Poorly suited		> 8 percent  
		Somewhat suited 	<= 8 to 3 percent
		Well suited		< 3 percent
		
	Null slopes are assigned to the Not rated class.
	
	
	
10.  Low strength: Soils with high AASHTO Group Index have low strength which affects the soil's traffic-supporting capacity.  This condition is only partially restrictive when clay mineralogy is kaolinitic.  Soil feature considered is the AASHTO Group Index of the
thickest soil layer between 25 and 100cm or above a cemented restrictive layer and taxonomic family mineralogy.

        Property used: AASHTO GROUP INDEX NUMBER THICKEST LAYER IN DEPTH 10-40 in. (Modality - high, low, representative value)

        Restriction limits:
                Limiting                	=> 8
                Somewhat limiting        	> 5 to < 8
                Not limiting           	 	=< 5

        Null AASHTO Group Index values are assigned to the ""Not rated"".
        
        
        
11.  Mean annual air temperature: Localities that have very low or very high mean annual air temperature are limited for use as composting facilities.  In places that have low mean annual air temperature, the onset of decomposition may be delayed by low biological activity in the composting mass.  The additional expense of covering or insulating the composting mass may be incurred.  In very warm areas, adding extra water and more frequent turning of the mass adds to the cost of composting.  The site feature considered is mean annual air temperature.

	Property used: MEAN ANNUAL AIR TEMPERATURE (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		 <= 8 and >30 degrees C 
		Somewhat limiting	 8 to <=10 and 22 to <=30 degrees C
		Not limiting		 >10 to <=22 degrees C
		
	Null mean annual air temperature is assigned to the ""Not rated"" class.

12.  Piping: Fine textured soils high in sodium and gypsum content with low cohesion and liquid limits are subject to piping and are limited for use in building embankments, dikes, and levees.   The interpretive model uses the maximum sodium or gypsum rating index and adds the low cohesion index.  This sum is compared to the liquid limit index and the lowest index is applied to the parent rule.

	{Soil feature considered is the maximum percent gypsum found in the soil layers.
	
	Property used: GYPSUM MAXIMUM (Modality - high, low, representative value)
			
	Restriction limits:

Background

Composting: The Process of Biological Degradation

Biological degradation of organic materials forms the basis for composting.  This biological process depends on the active metabolism of microorganisms in a suitable micro-environment. The six critical factors for the transformation of organic materials into compost are microorganisms, heat, air, water, carbon, and nitrogen.

The microorganisms that carry out biological degradation for composting often are found in the soil or on the surface of leaves.  These microorganisms thrive in a surface or subsurface microclimate with free circulation of air, free flow of water, and a temperature well above freezing. The microorganisms also require carbon as food for energy and growth, as well as nitrogen for protein and rebuilding cells.

Composting facilities are designed to provide these six critical factors in relative proportions so that the process of biological degradation is sustained.  Deficits in any of the critical factors, or imbalances among them, may result in extremely slow composting or a dormant composting system. Mixing of materials also redistributes heat, air, and water and will speed the process of biological degradation. Large facilities may provide mechanical mixing of the compost materials. Smaller facilities may rely on manual turning of the materials or may add some materials that are too large to compost in order to create channels for air flow through the pile. 

Mean Annual Precipitation (MAP) and Mean Annual Air Temperature (MAAT) are measures of the soil micro-climate that affects the rate of composting.  Both MAP and MAAT are available from the soil survey database.  Composting is most rapid in warm, moist areas that generally have MAP between 450 and 1250 mm together with MAAT between 5 and 10 degrees Celsius.  The optimal temperature inside the compost pile is 10 to 15.5 degrees Celsius. In colder areas the rate of composting may be increased by insulating the compost pile on all sides with an extra layer of high carbon materials such as hay or newspaper. To avoid extreme cold or rainforest conditions, the composting may be done inside a protected area or a building.  The optimal moisture for composting is field capacity, or freely drained but moist. Moisture may need to be added to the compost pile especially if the organic materials are dry such as chipped lumber. 

The ratio of carbon to nitrogen in the organic materials is perhaps the hardest part of the process to regulate.  Active compost piles need a carbon to nitrogen ratio of about 30:1 (30 units of carbon to 1 unit of nitrogen). Many common materials such as leaves and lumber are high in carbon and require balanced inputs of materials that are high in nitrogen such as coffee grounds or manures and urines.  Often the materials high in nitrogen are less available or more difficult to transport to the composting site. Materials intended for composting may vary in their carbon to nitrogen ratio due to many factors and testing of materials is recommended before large scale operations begin. A few C:N examples are given in table 1.

Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as a subsurface ""Site for Composting Facility"".  If a soil's property within 200 cm (about 79 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""Site for Composting Facility - Subsurface"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Site for subsurface composting facility is the site location for placement of a subsurface composting facility without the use of a liner or placement on concrete pad. The composting facility is to process raw manure or other raw organic by-products into biologically stable organic material as outlined in the NRCS conservation practice standard ""Composting Facility"" (code 317). 

Scope: National

The bottom elevation of the composting facility shall be above the seasonal high water table and on soils with an acceptable permeability that does not allow materials to contaminate the ground water. Compost facilities should be located outside of floodplains.  However, if site restrictions require location within a floodplain, they shall be protected from inundation or damage from a 25-year flood event, or larger. Locate compost facilities so prevailing winds and landscape elements such as building arrangement, landforms and vegetation minimize odors and protect the visual resource. 

Suitability of a soil for use as a site for composting should be on soils with an acceptable permeability that does not allow materials to contaminate the ground water. On sloping soils, cut perpendicular to the contour to obtain level surface for composting facility. Direct any contaminated runoff from compost facilities to an appropriate storage or treatment facility for further management.

Soil interpretations for locating a site for composting are used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for the practice.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.





Criteria used:

1.  Adsorption:  Soils having a low cec or ecec may not attenuate biohazardous material from the decay process.  It is assumed that the upper 25 cm of the site will be stockpiled for use in revegetating the site.  It is also assumed that alternating layers of soil and biological materials will be placed in the excavation.

Soils having low CEC or ECEC are not able to retain some leachates.  A soil is a full member of the set of soils having low adsorption if the CEC or ECEC to clay ratio is below 0.05, a partial member between 0.05 and 0.15, and a nonmember if the cec or ecec to clay ratio is over 0.150.
	
	Property used: CLAY ACTIVITY IN DEPTH 30-200cm (Modality - low, high, representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		Below 0.05 meq/100g
		Somewhat limiting	0.05-0.15 meq/100g
		Not limiting		> 0.15 meq/100g
		
	The fuzzy number is weighted by 0.25, meaning this rule cannot cause the component to be absolutely true that the site is limited for the intended land use.

			
Null clay activity is assigned to the ""Not Rated"" class.

	
2.  Porous bedrock: Limestone bedrock (and other types) may have numerous solution channels that allow contaminants to enter the groundwater quickly and with no renovation.  The porous nature of the bedrock is often reflected by ""karst"" phases of map units.  Deeper soils will tend to lessen the risk of contamination.

		  Evaluation used: BEDROCK IS LIMESTONE

		  
		  Property used: LIMESTONE RESIDUUM TEST, NULL SENDS NO
		  
		  Restrictive Limits:
		    Limiting		If the bedrock is limestone, the site is limited by the bedrock type.
		    Not limiting	If the bedrock is not limestone, the site is not limited by the bedrock type.
		    
		    
		  NOTE!!!  As the property is now written, if bedrock is not populated, a N0 is returned.
		  NOTE!!!  This base rule will be expanded to evaluate more types of bedrock.
		  
		  
		  Evaluation used: Parent Material Origin is Soluble Salt
		  
		  Property used: ""PARENT MATERIAL ORIGIN IS SOLUBLE SALT""  (Modality - and representative value)
	
			Limiting	If the bedrock is soluble salt, the site is limited by the bedrock type.
		    	Not limiting	If the bedrock is not soluble salt, the site is not limited by the bedrock type.
		    	
3.  Depth to thick/thin cemented pan: Depth to thick or thin cemented pan may pose construction limitations or environmental and health risks when potentially hazardous materials are buried in the soil.   Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer more then 46cm thick where restrictive kind is ""fragipan"", ""duripan"", ""petrocalcic"", ""ortstein"", or ""petrogypsic"" and restrictive feature hardness is not noncemented. If pan thickness is < 46cm then the rating is reduced by half.  Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table.

	
	Property used: DEPTH TO CEMENTED PAN THICK (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:

	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		not = noncemented
		Not limiting		    = noncemented
				
	Null hardness is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
		  
		  
4.  Instability of excavation walls:  Under certain circumstances, the sides of an excavation may collapse.  This can be hazardous to anyone in the trench or near the edge at the time of failure.  The sloughed material may need to be removed from the trench, increasing the time needed to excavate.  The sides of the trench may need to be made to reflect the angle of repose of the material or be shored.
	
	
		A. Instability of the excavation walls can be caused by the coarseness of the soil material.
		
		Property used: FRAGMENT PERCENT IN DEPTH 30-200CM (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		
		Restrictive limits:
		     Limiting		Above 80 percent by volume
		     Somewhat limiting	60-80 percent by volume
		     Not limiting	Less than 60 percent by volume
		     
		 Property used: SAND PERCENT LESS CLAY IN DEPTH 30-180CM
		 
		 Restrictive limits:
		     Limiting		Above 185
		     Somewhat limiting	170-185
		     Not limiting	Less than 170
		     
		  (The clay content is subtracted from the sand content.  100 is added to the difference to keep the numbers positive.  This number is a sort of effective sand content, adjusting for the adhesiveness of clay.)
		     
		     
		 B.  High shrink-swell can cause instability of excavation walls.

		  Property used: SILT PERCENT IN DEPTH 30-200CM
		  
		  Restrictive limits:
		     Somewhat limiting	Greater than 75 percent silt
		     Not limiting	Less than 75 percent silt
		     
		  Silt content is not considered to ever be a severe limitation.
		  
		  
		   D. Gypsiferous soils can be non-cohesive if they are not cemented.  The amount of gypsum is related to the instability hazard, as is the depth to the cememnted layer, if one exists.  This subrule examines the gypsum content and the depth to a cemented layer.  A cemented gypsiferous soil is not considered to be a cave in hazard.

			Limiting		75-200 cm
			Severely limiting 	 >=200 cm
		  
		  


5.  Depth to saturated zone: Shallow depth to water table limits the site for use as a composting facility.  Soils that are shallow to water are also difficult to reclaim and revegetate, and contamination from leaching may create health and environmental hazards.  Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first layer where soil moisture layer status is wet or saturated during any month.

	Property used: HIGH WATER TABLE DEPTH MINIMUM (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:

		Somewhat suited 	=> 3 to 15 percent
		Well suited		 < 3 percent
		
	Null surface fragment coverage is assigned to the Well suited class.

		  

8.  Content of organic matter: Soil in Unified class pt, ol, or oh is high in organic materials, has low strength, and is hard to reclaim.  Soil feature considered is the rv or first Unified class of the thickest soil layer above a restrictive layer and between 30 and 200cm.
	
	Property used: UNIFIED THICKEST LAYER 30-200cm (Modality - representative value)

		Not limiting	not = pt, ol, or oh
		
	Null Unified classes are assigned to the Not limiting class.

		  
9.  Depth to permafrost: Permafrost (permanently frozen soil layer) restricts or effects excavation, manipulation, transport, stability, and workability of the soil material.  Soil features considered are restrictive feature depth and where kind is permafrost or USDA TEXTURE (IN-LIEU-OF) is ""cpf"" or USDA TEXTURE MODIFIER is ""pf"".
	
	Property used: DEPTH TO PERMAFROST (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:

	Property used: USDA TEXTURE MODIFIER (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting	= ""pf""
		Not limiting	not = ""pf""
		
	Null USDA Texture Modifier are assigned to the Not limiting class.
	


10.  Ponding:  If the number of months a soil component has frequent or occasional ponding falls within the following parameters then the rule returns a value greater than 0 and ponding is a limiting feature:

Ponding Frequency	Months
-----------------	------
Frequent		>0
Occasional		>2


11.  Precipitation:  Mean annual precipitation: Localities that have low rainfall are limited for use as composting facilities.  In places that have low rainfall, moisture will need to be added to maintain biological activity in the composting mass.  The site feature considered is mean annual precipitation.

	Property used: PRECIPITATION (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		
		Somewhat limiting    	= 0-1200 mm
		Not limiting		 > 1200 mm
	
                The fuzzy number for this rule is limited with a 0.25 multiplier hedge to never be more than somewhat limiting.
	Null precipitation is assigned to the ""Not rated"" class.
	
	
	
12.  Large stone impede the workability of the soil and restrict trafficability of heavy machinery and site reclamation. Soil feature considered is the weighted average percentage of rock fragments of size greater than 75mm in the horizons above a restrictive feature or from 0 to 200 cm deep.

            Property used: FRAGMENTS > 75mm Wt. Ave. 0-200cm (Modality - high, low, representative value)

            Restrictive limits:

13.  Rock Outcrop:  Areas that have rock outcrop in the vicinity are not likely to have a sufficiently large area of soil for the facility.  Rock outcrops can interfere with renovation of the leachate from the facility.
        
        Property used: PA ROCK OUTCROP 2(Modality - representative value)
        
        Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		The phase ""rock outcrop"" occurs in the map unit name.
		Not limiting		The phase ""rock outcrop"" does not occur in the map unit name.
		
		
Any soil with a portion or full map unit name of Rock Outcrop is returned as a value of 1 and is given the rating of Rock Outcrop and is considered a limitation.

Any soil with a portion of the map unit name listed as ""rocky"" is returned as a value of .3 and is given the rating of ""Slight Rock Outcrop"".

Any soil with a portion of the map unit name listed as ""very rocky"" is returned as a value of .7 and is given the rating of ""Severe Rock Outcrop"".

All map units have a name, no null data should be encountered.



14.  Seepage:  The soil's bottom layer Ksat governs the leaching and seepage potential of the soil.   When this rate is high, transmission of fluids through the soil and underlying materials is unimpeded and leaching and seepage may become environmental, health, and performance concern.  Soil feature considered is the Ksat of the bottom layer or the layer immediately above bedrock.  This condition is not restrictive for soil in Aridic moisture regimes.  
	
	Property used: KSAT BOTTOM HORIZON (Modality - high, low, representative value)
			
	Restriction limits:
		Limiting 	 	 => 14.0 micrometers/sec
		Not limiting		  < 14.0 micrometers/sec
		
	Null Ksat values are assigned to the Not rated class.
	
6/15/04 PRF modified the hedge from ""NULL NOT RATED"" to ""NOT NULL AND"".  The Null values were throwing out a ""Not Rated"" that affected the final rating.



15.  Depth to bedrock: Shallow depth to bedrock limits the soil's adsorptive capacity and the thickness of the biologically active zone through with waste materials can percolate.  Shallow soils may pose environmental and health risks when agricultural and municipal waste materials are applied. These soils may pose construction limitations or environmental and health risks when trench landfills are installed. Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restrictive type is ""bedrock (lithic)"" or ""bedrock (paralithic)."" Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table. 

	Property used: DEPTH TO BEDROCK (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		 < 200cm
		Not limiting		=> 200cm

16.  Slope: Steep slopes impede trafficability of heavy machinery and reclamation of borrow sites.  Soil feature considered is the component slope.
		
	Property used: SLOPE (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		
	Restriction limits:
		Limiting		> 15%
		Somewhat limiting	>= 8 and <= 15%
		Not limiting		< 8%			
		
	Null Slope is assigned Not rated.
	
	
	
	
17.  Mean annual air temperature: Localities that have very low or very high mean annual air temperature are limited for use as composting facilities.  In places that have low mean annual air temperature, the onset of decomposition may be delayed by low biological activity in the composting mass.  The additional expense of covering or insulating the composting mass may be incurred.  In very warm areas, adding extra water and more frequent turning of the mass adds to the cost of composting.  The site feature considered is mean annual air temperature.

	Property used: MEAN ANNUAL AIR TEMPERATURE (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		 <= 8 and >30 degrees C 
		Somewhat limiting	 8 to <=10 and 22 to <=30 degrees C
		Not limiting		 >10 to <=22 degrees C
		
	Null mean annual air temperature is assigned to the ""Not rated"" class.	
	
	
18.  Water Gathering Surface: Some surfaces are shaped so as to gather water.  This additional water may cause problems for land use.  Soils that are concave up and down their slope and concave across their slope are most strongly water gathering.  Soils that are concave across their slope and linear or convex up and down their slopes are less water collecting.  Soils that are linear across their slopes and concave up and down their slopes are somewhat water collecting.  Soils that are convex up and down their slopes and convex across their slopes are the least water gathering.

Water gathering (concave) surfaces can concentrate water flow and cause accelerated erosion.  Increased costs because of materials and land shaping may be needed to prevent erosion.
		  
		  Property Used: WATER GATHERING SURFACE
		  
		  Restrictive limits:
		    Somewhat Limiting		Concave up-down, concave across surfaces
		    Slightly limiting		Concave across, linear or convex up-down
		    Not limiting		All other surface shapes
		    
		  NOTE!!!  The fuzzy number returned by this rule can not exceed 0.5.
		  
Null slope shape is assigned to the ""Not Rated"" class.

19. Piping: Fine textured soils high in sodium and gypsum content with low cohesion and liquid limits are subject to piping and are limited for use in building embankments, dikes, and levees.   The interpretive model uses the maximum sodium or gypsum rating index and adds the low cohesion index.  This sum is compared to the liquid limit index and the lowest index is applied to the parent rule.

CO643,"DHS - Rubble and Debris Disposal, Large-Scale Event",limitation,"Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use for ""Rubble and Debris Disposal, Large-scale Event"".  If a soil's property within 200 cm (about 80 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""Rubble and Debris Disposal, Large-scale Event"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Rubble and Debris Disposal, Large-scale Event is a method of disposing of material that has been rendered unsafe and unusable by the effects of a large-scale disaster, either natural or man-made, affecting tens of counties or parishes.  Many homes and business structures will be ruined, either by smashing or contamination.  

The assumptions are as follows.  This method is to be used to permanently dispose of material that would be hazardous to public health if left exposed in the aftermath of a major flood, fire, earthquake, wind storm, or other severe weather.  Disposal of material involved in a radiological disaster is outside of the scope of this interpretation.  Large animal disposal is addressed in another interpretation.  Time is of the essence in the disposal to avoid air quality and groundwater degradation and disease or the exacerbation of respiratory conditions, particularly with material involved in flooding.  The amount of geotechnical background work at the disposal site may not be as extensive as at a normal landfill, thus the soil criteria are stringent.  A site, such as a large parking lot, is available to field-separate the materials into several classes.  The material to be buried is expected to consist largely of lumber, broken drywall, upholstered furniture, household chemicals, electronic devices, insulation, roofing materials, pressure-treated lumber, mobile homes, and anything else not considered environmentally safe to incinerate or feasible to recycle.  This material is expected to be contaminated with mold, rodent droppings, and sediment.  Some materials retrieved from the structures, such as appliances, are expected to be recycled.  Combustible material, such as fallen trees, limbs, and lumber may be burned near the disaster area, if doing so is safe.  The ash will be disposed of at a licensed landfill.  Inert materials, such as bricks and concrete blocks, are expected to be used as fill in the local area.  Limiting the distance to the disposal site from where the material originates is considered desirable.  Access roads will need to be constructed to get to the site.  When the trench is full, a final cover of soil material at least 2 feet thick is placed over the landfill and the area revegetated.

Scope: National

The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or floodwater.  Potential contamination may be reduced or eliminated by installing systems designed to overcome or reduce the effects of the limiting soil property.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Ratings are based on properties and qualities to the depth normally observed during soil mapping (approximately 6 feet).  However, because excavations may be as deep as 15 feet or more, geologic investigations are needed to determine the potential for pollution of ground water as well as to determine the design needed.  These investigations include the examination of stratification, rock formations, and geologic conditions that might lead to the conducting of leachates to aquifers, wells, watercourses, and other water sources.  The presence of hard, nonrippable bedrock, bedrock crevices, or highly permeable strata in or immediately underlying the proposed pit bottom is undesirable because of the difficulty in excavation and the potential pollution of underground water.

Properties that influence the risk of pollution, ease of excavation, trafficability, and revegetation are major considerations.  Soils that flood or have a water table within the depth of excavation present a potential pollution hazard and are difficult to excavate.  Slope is an important consideration because it affects the work involved in road construction, the performance of the roads, and the control of surface water around the landfill.  It may also cause difficulty in constructing trenches for which the trench bottom must be kept level and oriented to follow the contour.

The ease with which the trench is dug and with which a soil can be used as daily and final covers is based largely on texture and consistence of the soil.  The texture and consistence of a soil determine the degree of workability of the soil both when dry and when wet.  Soils that are plastic and sticky when wet are difficult to excavate, grade, or compact and difficult to place as a uniformly thick cover over a layer of refuse.  The uppermost part of the final cover should be soil material that is favorable for the growth of plants.  It should not contain excess sodium or salt and should not be too acid.  In comparison with other horizons, the A horizon in most soils has the best workability and the highest content of organic matter.  Thus, for a Rubble and Debris Disposal, Large-scale Event site it may be desirable to stockpile the surface layer for use in the final blanketing of the fill.




Criteria used:

1.  Adsorption:  Soils having a low cec or ecec may not attenuate biohazardous material from the decay process.  It is assumed that the upper 25 cm of the site will be stockpiled for use in revegetating the site.  It is also assumed that alternating layers of soil and biological materials will be placed in the excavation.

Soils having low CEC or ECEC are not able to retain some leachates.  A soil is a full member of the set of soils having low adsorption if the CEC or ECEC to clay ratio is below 0.05, a partial member between 0.05 and 0.15, and a nonmember if the cec or ecec to clay ratio is over 0.150.
	
	Property used: CLAY ACTIVITY IN DEPTH 30-200cm (Modality - low, high, representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		Below 0.05 meq/100g
		Somewhat limiting	0.05-0.15 meq/100g
		Not limiting		> 0.15 meq/100g
		
	The fuzzy number is weighted by 0.25, meaning this rule cannot cause the component to be absolutely true that the site is limited for the intended land use.

			
Null clay activity is assigned to the ""Not Rated"" class.

2.   Porous bedrock: Limestone bedrock (and other types) may have numerous solution channels that allow contaminants to enter the groundwater quickly and with no renovation.  The porous nature of the bedrock is often reflected by ""karst"" phases of map units.  Deeper soils will tend to lessen the risk of contamination.

		  Evaluation used: BEDROCK IS LIMESTONE

		  
		  Property used: LIMESTONE RESIDUUM TEST, NULL SENDS NO
		  
		  Restrictive Limits:
		    Limiting		If the bedrock is limestone, the site is limited by the bedrock type.
		    Not limiting	If the bedrock is not limestone, the site is not limited by the bedrock type.
		    
		    
		  NOTE!!!  As the property is now written, if bedrock is not populated, a N0 is returned.
		  NOTE!!!  This base rule will be expanded to evaluate more types of bedrock.
		  
		  
		  Evaluation used: Parent Material Origin is Soluble Salt
		  
		  Property used: ""PARENT MATERIAL ORIGIN IS SOLUBLE SALT""  (Modality - and representative value)
	
			Limiting	If the bedrock is soluble salt, the site is limited by the bedrock type.
		    	Not limiting	If the bedrock is not soluble salt, the site is not limited by the bedrock type.
		    	
		   	  
		  
3.  Depth to thick/thin cemented pan: Depth to thick or thin cemented pan may pose construction limitations or environmental and health risks when potentially hazardous materials are buried in the soil.   Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer more then 46cm thick where restrictive kind is ""fragipan"", ""duripan"", ""petrocalcic"", ""ortstein"", or ""petrogypsic"" and restrictive feature hardness is not noncemented. If pan thickness is < 46cm then the rating is reduced by half.  Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table.

	
	Property used: DEPTH TO CEMENTED PAN THICK (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:

		Not limiting		=< 182cm
		
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.
		
AND NOT
	
	Property used: RESTRICTIVE FEATURE HARDNESS (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:

		Not limiting		    = noncemented
				
	Null hardness is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	
4.  Too clayey:  This rule evaluates textures from the thickest layers between 30 and 200 cm.  Textures of cl, sicl, sc, sic, and c are rated as too clayey.  If clay minerology is kaolinitic or the soil is in an aridic moisture regime the clay content is not a restrictive feature.  Clayey soils may become sticky when wet and are difficult to spread and compact.  This condition is not restrictive for soil in Aridic moisture regimes and is only partially restrictive when clay mineralogy is kaolinitic. Soil feature considered is the weighted average of clay content between 30 and 200cm or above a restrictive layer and taxonomic family mineralogy.
		
	Property used: CLAY PERCENT IN DEPTH 30-200CM (Modality - representative value)
		
	Restriction limits:
		Limiting		>45 percent
		Somewhat limiting	27-45 percent
		Not limiting		<27 percent
			
	Null clay contents are assigned to the Not rated class.
 
	AND

	Property used: TAXONOMIC MINERALOGY CLASS (Modality - representative value)
		
	Restriction limits:
		If taxonomic family mineralogy is kaolinitic then
		the soil clayey rating is reduced by multiplying by 0.5.
			
	Null taxonomic mineralogy classes are assigned Not Rated.
	
5.  Instability of excavation walls:  Under certain circumstances, the sides of an excavation may collapse.  This can be hazardous to anyone in the trench or near the edge at the time of failure.  The sloughed material may need to be removed from the trench, increasing the time needed to excavate.  The sides of the trench may need to be made to reflect the angle of repose of the material or be shored.
	
	
		A. Instability of the excavation walls can be caused by the coarseness of the soil material.
		
		Property used: FRAGMENT PERCENT IN DEPTH 30-200CM (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		
		Restrictive limits:
		     Limiting		Above 80 percent by volume

		     Not limiting	Less than 60 percent by volume
		     
		 Property used: SAND PERCENT LESS CLAY IN DEPTH 30-180CM
		 
		 Restrictive limits:
		     Limiting		Above 185
		     Somewhat limiting	170-185
		     Not limiting	Less than 170
		     
		  (The clay content is subtracted from the sand content.  100 is added to the difference to keep the numbers positive.  This number is a sort of effective sand content, adjusting for the adhesiveness of clay.)
		     
		     
		 B.  High shrink-swell can cause instability of excavation walls.
		 
		 Property used: LEP 25-200cm OR ABOVE RESTRICTIVE LAYER WTD_AVE
		 
		 Restrictive limits:
		     Limiting		LEP above 9
		     Somwewhat limiting	LEP 6 to 9
		     Not limiting	LEP less than 6
		     
		     
		  C. Silty material that is not loess can be unstable.
		  
		  Property used: PARENT MATERIAL KIND IS LOESS
		  
		  Restrictive limits:
		     Limiting		High silt and not loess
		     Not limiting	High silt and is loess
		     
		  Property used: SILT PERCENT IN DEPTH 30-200CM
		  
		  Restrictive limits:
		     Somewhat limiting	Greater than 75 percent silt
		     Not limiting	Less than 75 percent silt
		     
		  Silt content is not considered to ever be a severe limitation.
		  
		  
		   D. Gypsiferous soils can be non-cohesive if they are not cemented.  The amount of gypsum is related to the instability hazard, as is the depth to the cememnted layer, if one exists.  This subrule examines the gypsum content and the depth to a cemented layer.  A cemented gypsiferous soil is not considered to be a cave in hazard.

			Property used:  GYPSUM 10-200cm OR ABOVE RESTRICTIVE LAYER WTD_AVE

6.  Too Sandy: Sandy soils may slump and are droughty, making establishment of vegetative cover difficult.  Soil feature considered is the sand content, minus clay, of the thickest soil layer between 25 and 200cm or above a cemented restrictive layer.  This rule evaluates the weighted average of sand minus clay between 30 and 180 cm.  Textures of LCOS, LS, LFS, LVFS, COS, S, FS, VFS, and SG are rated as too sandy.
		
	Property used: SAND PERCENT LESS CLAY IN DEPTH 30-200CM (Modality - representative value)

	Null frequency is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	
	
8.  Depth to saturated zone: Soils with shallow depth to a water table may become waterlogged and boggy during periods of heavy precipitation and are slow to drain.  These soils have the potential to contamination the ground water which may create health and environmental hazards.

	Null frequency is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	
	
14.  Rock Outcrop:  Areas that have rock outcrop in the vicinity are not likely to have a sufficiently large area of soil for the facility.  Rock outcrops can interfere with renovation of the leachate from the facility.

Any soil with a portion or full map unit name of Rock Outcrop is returned as a value of 1 and is given the rating of Rock Outcrop and is considered a limitation.

Any soil with a portion of the map unit name listed as ""rocky"" is returned as a value of .3 and is given the rating of ""Slight Rock Outcrop"".

Any soil with a portion of the map unit name listed as ""very rocky"" is returned as a value of .7 and is given the rating of ""Severe Rock Outcrop"".

All map units have a name, no null data should be encountered.

6/15/04 PRF modified the hedge from ""NULL NOT RATED"" to ""NOT NULL AND"".  The Null values were throwing out a ""Not Rated"" that affected the final rating.



17.  Depth to bedrock: Shallow depth to bedrock limits the soil's adsorptive capacity and the thickness of the biologically active zone through with waste materials can percolate.  Shallow soils may pose environmental and health risks when agricultural and municipal waste materials are applied. These soils may pose construction limitations or environmental and health risks when trench landfills are installed. Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restrictive type is ""bedrock (lithic)"" or ""bedrock (paralithic)."" Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table. 

	Property used: DEPTH TO BEDROCK (Modality - representative value)

		Limiting		> 15%
		Somewhat limiting	>= 8 and <= 15%
		Not limiting		< 8%

19.  Sodium content: Soils with high sodium adsorption ratio have the potential to restrict plan growth and re-establishing vegetation in disturbed area. This condition is not restrictive for soil in Aridic moisture regimes.  Soil feature considered is the horizon with the highest sodium adsorption ratio.

20.  Water Gathering Surface: Some surfaces are shaped so as to gather water.  This additional water may cause problems for land use.  Soils that are concave up and down their slope and concave across their slope are most strongly water gathering.  Soils that are concave across their slope and linear or convex up and down their slopes are less water collecting.  Soils that are linear across their slopes and concave up and down their slopes are somewhat water collecting.  Soils that are convex up and down their slopes and convex across their slopes are the least water gathering.

Water gathering (concave) surfaces can concentrate water flow and cause accelerated erosion.  Increased costs because of materials and land shaping may be needed to prevent erosion.

		  Restrictive limits:
		    Somewhat Limiting		Concave up-down, concave across surfaces
		    Slightly limiting		Concave across, linear or convex up-down
		    Not limiting		All other surface shapes
		    
		  NOTE!!!  The fuzzy number returned by this rule can not exceed 0.5.
		  
Null slope shape is assigned to the ""Not Rated"" class.



21.  Too acid: Soils with low pH increase metallic ion availability and restricts plant growth and re-establishing vegetation in disturbed area.  Soil feature considered is the minimum (pH) of the soil layers.
	
	Property used: SOIL REACTION 1-1 WATER (Minimum) (Modality - high, low, representative value)
				
	Restriction limits:
		Limiting	 < 3.5
		Not limiting	=> 3.5
			
	Null pH values are assigned to the Not rated class.

22.  Dustiness is a concern for human health as well as aesthetic reasons.  Dust generation from roads is a significant source of inhalable particulate matter.  Two dust particle sizes are recognized: PM10 and PM2.5, relating to particles of aerodynamic diameters of 10 and 2.5 microns, respectively.  The capacity of soils to produce dust particles has been found by Carvacho et al (2004) to be directly related to the clay or silt content of the soil.  Thus, the PM10 or PM2.5 generation capacity of a soil is inversely proportional to its sand content.  Gupsum is also related to dustiness because the soft crystals are relatively easily crushed to silt and clay size particles which can then be picked up by air.

Other major variables in dust generation are moisture content, vehicle size, and the amount of traffic on the road.

The ""Dryness Index"" accounts for the moisture content of the surface.  In a dry, hot environment, the generation of dust is greater than in a cool, moist environment.  Thus dust generation is directly proportional to temperature and inversely proportional to rainfall.

An array of materials is available for overcoming dust limitations (Gebhart et al, 1999).

Background:

Strontium-90 and Cesium-137 are radionuclides that can be released into the atmosphere as a result of above-ground nuclear explosions and inadvertent leakage from nuclear facilities, such as powerplants.  The behavior of strontium in the soil system is close to calcium.  Both are divalent metal cations.  Strontium, having a slightly smaller hydrated radius is more tightly held by the exchange complex than calcium.  Cesium acts in a fashion similar to potassium.  Both are monovalent metal cations.  Cesium is held more tightly that potassium, due to a smaller hydrated radius.  The characteristics of the soil upon which the radionuclides fall determines whether or not and to what extent they are available to plants and subsequently to animals.

Cations such as strontium or cesium added to the surface of the soil as fallout can have one of several fates.  

1 - They can be taken up by plants and cycled in the organic matter of the soil.  This is particularly true in acidic forest soils where the pH is below 5.5.  At this level of pH, aluminum solubilizes and can become the dominant cation in many soils, essentially driving basic cations off of the exchange into solution, where either they are absorbed by plant roots or they leach from the soil system. 
2 - They can be tied to the exchange surface and rendered more or less unavailable for plant uptake.  Owing to their small concentrations and generally high affinity for adsorption by the exchange, a soil having a large supply of basic cations and plentiful exchange sites will bind the radionuclides away from absorption by plant roots owing simply to mass action.  
3 - If the soil lacks the exchange capacity or the soil reaction is unfavorable for attenuation, they can be leached below the root zone and eventually into ground water or surface waters.  
4 - If the soil contains carbonates or sulfates, strontium can be tied up in the structures of these compounds.  
5 - Cesium, which is similar in ionic radius and charge to potassium can be absorbed by 2:1 layer silicates.

The sequestration of cesium and strontium is favored by several soil conditions.  High cation exchange capacity in the upper 30cm of soil causes these ions to be absorbed rather than in soil solution.  pH above 5.5 causes the exchange complex to be largely available for basic cations, which allows cesium and strontium to be taken proportionally from soil solution.  A thin organic surface provides less of a reservoir for cesium and strontium.  A preponderance of clay minerals in the soil enhances the extent to which cesium and strontium can be attenuated by the soil.  When first deposited, particulate to which cesium and strontium are adsorbed can be moved around on the landscape by water and wind, so convex land surfaces are less susceptible to accumulation.  If calcium carbonate or gypsum are present, strontium can be tightly held in these minerals and not available for uptake. 


Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member, or complete members of the set of soils that are suspected of having a high  Potential for Radioactive Sequestration of radionuclides in soil constituents, either oragnic or mineral.  If a soil's properties within 30 cm (~12 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater than zero, then that soil property contributes to the sequestration of radioactive material.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""Potential for Radioactive Sequestration"" interpretive rule.  Minor contributing soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These contributing features could be important factors where the major contributing features are overcome through management, when possible.  Studies from Europe indicate a fairly low mobility in soils, so only the upper 30cm of the profile is considered (Hrachowitz et al, 2005).

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are very low sequestration potential  (rating index = 0), some sequestration potential (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or high sequestration potential (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Potential for Radioactive Sequestration is a method of arraying soils based on their potential ability to sequester radionuclides.  This information can be displayed spatially to show the extent and location of areas where sequestration may occur in the event of a leakage of radioactive material.

Scope: National

The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Criteria used:

1.  Carbonate sequestration:  Calcium carbonate in the soil tightly holds strontium, so if a soil has appreciable carbonates, the potential for sequestration is high.


Property used: CALCIUM CARBONATE FROM 0 to 30cm


Limits:

	CCE	0	no sequestering from CaCO3
	CCE	0-10	some sequestering from CaCO3
	CCE	>10	high degree of sequestering from CaCO3
	
	Null CaCO3 is assigned 0.
	
	
	
2.  The type and amount of clay in the upper 30cm of the soil can affect the sequestration or holding of cesium and strontium.  The pH of the soil affects the suite of cations available in soil solution.  At higher pH, the exchange is dominated by basic cations, which plants take up and use.  In lower pH systems, the exchange is dominated by hydrogen and aluminum, which plants do not absorb.  Thus, the beneficial, in terms of sequestration, effects of the clay content are negated as pH is decreased.  This subrule models the change in sequestration from a higher pH system to a lower pH.

Subrules used:

Sequestration Clay Content, Raw
Bioaccumulation pH

The fuzzy numbers from these subrules are used in the calculation.

Calculation:  Sequestration Clay Content = (Sequestration Clay Content, Raw)-(Bioaccumulation pH)


	A.  The clay content of the upper 30cm of the soil determines in part how available to plants various ions added by eolean additions may be.  In a soil having a large amount of clay, the ability of the soil to tie up ions in the lattice, especially cesium in 2:1 clays, can decrease the plant availability of the added cations from fallout. 


Property used:  WTD_AVG CLAY CONTENT 0-30cm OR ABOVE RESTRICTION

Limits:


	clay content	0 percent	low potential for sequestration
	clay content	>0-18 percent	moderate potential for sequestration
	clay content	>18 percent	high potential for sequestration.
	
	Null clay content is assigned ""Not Rated"".
	
	
	B.  The pH of the upper 30cm of the soil determines in part the concentrations of various ions in soil solution.  In soils having a high pH, the ions added by eolean additions will comprise a smaller portion of the cations available for plant uptake.  It is assumed that in soils having a higher pH, the base saturation will be higher and so the cesium and strontium will represent a smaller proportion of the available cations in soil solution.  It is also assumed plants will not preferentially adsorb the radioactive constituents.  If the pH is low, the cations from fallout will be taken  up by plants and cycled.    

Property used:  WTD_AVG PH 0-30cm OR ABOVE RESTRICTION 

Limits:


	pH 	<5.0	low potential for sequestration   
	pH 	5.0-7.0	moderate potential for sequestration   
	pH 	>7.0	high potential for sequestration.
	
	Null pH is assigned ""Not Rated"".
	
	
3.  Calcium sulfate in the soil tightly holds strontium, so if a soil has appreciable gypsum, the potential for sequestration is high.


Property used: GYPSUM FROM 0 to 30cm


Limits:

	gypsum content	0 percent	no sequestering from gypsum 
	gypsum content	0-10 percent	some sequestering from gypsum
	gypsum content	>10 percent	high degree of sequestering from gypsum
	
	Null gypsum content is assigned 0.
	
	
	
4.  Organic surface sequestration:  In a forested environment, particularly on acid, sandy soils, the surface organic horizon comprises the reservoir of available plant nutrients.  Nutrients are cycled, stored, and recycled through the organic mat.  As the subsurface soil becomes more fertile (contains more nutrients) the impact of the organic surface horizon is lessened and the added strontium and cesium can be effectively sequestered.  Soils having both high CEC and high pH are assumed to be fertile and more prone to sequester while soils that have low CEC and low pH are prone to have Sr and Cs more bioavailable.

Properties used:

MEQ 0-30cm OR RESTRICTION

Limits:

	pH 	<5.5	no sequestering   
	pH 	5.5-6.5	some sequestering

	Null pH is assigned ""Not Rated"".



THICKNESS OF SURFACE ORGANIC HORIZON

Limits:
	0 cm		No bioaccumulation in organic layer
	>0-20 cm	moderate potential of accumulation in organic layer
	>20 cm		high potential for accumulation in the organic layer.

Evaluations used:

MEQ 0-10 in depth 0-30cm

Organic Horizon Thickness.

The fuzzy numbers from these evaluations are used in the calculation.

Calculation:

Sequestration Organic Surface =[(MEQ 0-10 in depth 0-30cm/2)+(pH 5.5-6.5 in depth 0-30cm/2)] - Organic Horizon Thickness



5.  Convex areas on the landscape tend to spread or lose water and material and send it to adjacent areas.  Strontium and cesium are added to the soil surface as fallout and are thus susceptible to redistribution by erosion, especially when newly deposited on a surface lacking an organic layer.  The general consensus is that very little erosion occurs on soils having an O horizon.  Some soils are more erodible than others, due to their composition, as is related by the K factor.  Slope is a contributor to erosion.

Property used:  EROSION FACTOR SURFACE LAYER, ORGANIC 0.02

The bioaccumulation of cesium and strontium is favored by several soil conditions.  Low cation exchange capacity in the upper 30cm of soil causes these ions to be in soil solution rather than absorbed.  Low pH (below 5.5) causes the exchange complex to be largely aluminum saturated, which pushes cesium and strontium into soil solution.  A thick organic surface serves as a reservoir for cesium and strontium, especially for uptake and retention by fungi.  A lack of clay minerals in the soil enhances the extent of plant uptake and bioaccumulation.  When first deposited, particulate to which cesium and strontium are adsorbed can be moved around on the landscape by water and wind.  If calcium carbonate or gypsum are present, strontium can be tightly held in these minerals and not available for uptake. 


Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member, or complete members of the set of soils that are suspected of having a high  Hazard for Radioactive Bioaccumulation of radionuclides in plant material growing on the soil component.  If a soil's properties within 30 cm (~12 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater than zero, then that soil property contributes to the bioaccumulation of radioactive material.  The interpretive rating assigned is the minimum membership indices for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""Hazard for Radioactive Bioaccumulation"" interpretive rule.  Minor contributing soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These contributing features could be important factors where the major contributing features are overcome through management, when possible.

Criteria Used:


1.  In a soil where little leaching occurs, calcium carbonate or gypsum can accumulate, depending on how dry the soil is.  This subrule rule tests for either calcium carbonate or gypsum.  The lowest fuzzy number is sent to the main rule level.


Subrules used:

NSSC Data:Bioaccumulation carbonate
NSSC Data:Bioaccumulation gypsum

2.  Sorption:  This subrule tests the interaction of pH and CEC against the thickness of the organic surface.  These two factors represent the exchange complex of the soil.  The higher of the two fuzzy numbers is sent to the main level rule.


Subrules used:

NSSC Data: Bioaccumulation pH X CEC
NSSC Data: Bioaccumulation Organic Surface


	A.  It is thought that pH and CEC interact in influencing the availability of cesium and strontium in soil solution.  When pH and CEC are both high, then the availability of these ions is decreased.  When pH and CEC are both low, then the availability of these ions is higher.  Also, if one or the other of pH and CEC is lower, then the availability is increased.  In fuzzy systems as well as regression models, interaction of variables is indicated by multiplying them together.

	B.  The surface organic layer in many soils provides a reservoir for plant available nutrients.  Cesium and strontium act similar to the plant nutrients potassium and calcium and are treated in a similar manner by plants.  It is assumed in this subrule that a thicker layer will retain more strontium and cesium for cyclical reuse by plants.  Any material leaching below the surface is intercepted and incorporated into plant tissue to be returned to the soil when the plant dies.

The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership index for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""Catastrophic Mortality, Large Animal Disposal, Trench"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Catastrophic Mortality, Large Animal Disposal, Trench is a method of disposing dead animals by placing the carcasses in successive layers in an excavated trench.  The carcasses are spread, compacted, and covered daily with a thin layer of soil that is excavated from the trench.  When the trench is full, a final cover of soil material at least 2 feet thick is placed over the filled trench area.

Scope: National

The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or floodwater.  Potential contamination may be reduced or eliminated by installing systems designed to overcome or reduce the effects of the limiting soil property.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

The estimated land area needed to dispose of mature cattle ranges from 1.2 (McDaniel, 1991) to 3.5 (Ollis, 2002) cubic yards.  A single adult bovine is considered equivalent to 5 sheep or 5 hogs (McDaniel, 1991; USDA, 1980).  Lund et al estimate that about 92,000 cubic yards of volume would be needed to dispose of 30,000 head of cattle, assuming a trench depth of 8.5 feet (which is somewhat below the depth of observation for typical soil survey).  This is about seven acres.  Leachate collection should be considered because the putrefaction of one adult bovine is estimated to release 21 gallons of fluid in the first week and a total of about 42 gallons in the first month (Munroe, 2001).  Collection of gases released during the decomposition process should also be considered.  To bury adult hogs or sheep, a rule of thumb is to multiply the capacities listed above by five. For broiler chickens (market-ready weight), multiply the capacity by 200. For turkeys (market-ready weight) multiply the capacity by 40 (Ollis, 2002).  

Ratings are based on properties and qualities to the depth normally observed during soil mapping (approximately 6 or 7 feet).  However, because trenches may be as deep as 15 feet or more, geologic investigations are needed to determine the potential for pollution of ground water as well as to determine the design needed.  These investigations, which are generally arranged by the trench developer, include the examination of stratification, rock formations, and geologic conditions that might lead to the conducting of leachates to aquifers, wells, watercourses, and other water sources.  The presence of hard, nonrippable bedrock, bedrock crevices, or highly permeable strata in or immediately underlying the proposed trench bottom is undesirable because of the difficulty in excavation and the potential pollution of underground water.

Properties that influence the risk of pollution, ease of excavation, trafficability, and revegetation are major considerations.  Soils that flood or have a water table within the depth of excavation present a potential pollution hazard and are difficult to excavate.  Slope is an important consideration because it affects the work involved in road construction, the performance of the roads, and the control of surface water around the trench.  It may also cause difficulty in constructing trenches for which the trench bottom must be kept level and oriented to follow the contour.

The ease with which the trench is dug and with which a soil can be used as daily and final covers is based largely on texture and consistence of the soil.  The texture and consistence of a soil determine the degree of workability of the soil both when dry and when wet.  Soils that are plastic and sticky when wet are difficult to excavate, grade, or compact and difficult to place as a uniformly thick cover over a layer of carcasses.  The uppermost part of the final cover should be soil material that is favorable for the growth of plants.  It should not contain excess sodium or salt and should not be too acid.  In comparison with other horizons, the A horizon in most soils has the best workability and the highest content of organic matter.  Thus, for a Large Animal Disposal, Trench operation it may be desirable to stockpile the surface layer for use in the final blanketing of the filled area.

Criteria used:

1.  Adsorption:  Soils having a low cec or ecec may not attenuate biohazardous material from the decay process.  It is assumed that the upper 25 cm of the site will be stockpiled for use in revegetating the site.  It is also assumed that alternating layers of soil and biological materials will be placed in the excavation.

Soils having low CEC or ECEC are not able to retain some leachates.  A soil is a full member of the set of soils having low adsorption if the CEC or ECEC to clay ratio is below 0.05, a partial member between 0.05 and 0.15, and a nonmember if the cec or ecec to clay ratio is over 0.150.
	
	Property used: CLAY ACTIVITY IN DEPTH 30-200cm (Modality - low, high, representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		Below 0.05 meq/100g
		Somewhat limiting	0.05-0.15 meq/100g
		Not limiting		> 0.15 meq/100g
		
	The fuzzy number is weighted by 0.25, meaning this rule cannot cause the component to be absolutely true that the site is limited for the intended land use.

			
Null clay activity is assigned to the ""Not Rated"" class.

2.  Porous bedrock: Limestone bedrock (and other types) may have numerous solution channels that allow contaminants to enter the groundwater quickly and with no renovation.  The porous nature of the bedrock is often reflected by ""karst"" phases of map units.  Deeper soils will tend to lessen the risk of contamination.

		  Evaluation used: BEDROCK IS LIMESTONE

		  
		  Property used: LIMESTONE RESIDUUM TEST, NULL SENDS NO
		  
		  Restrictive Limits:
		    Limiting		If the bedrock is limestone, the site is limited by the bedrock type.
		    Not limiting	If the bedrock is not limestone, the site is not limited by the bedrock type.
		    
		    
		  NOTE!!!  As the property is now written, if bedrock is not populated, a N0 is returned.
		  NOTE!!!  This base rule will be expanded to evaluate more types of bedrock.
		  
		  
		  Evaluation used: Parent Material Origin is Soluble Salt
		  
		  Property used: ""PARENT MATERIAL ORIGIN IS SOLUBLE SALT""  (Modality - and representative value)

3.  Depth to thick/thin cemented pan: Depth to thick or thin cemented pan may pose construction limitations or environmental and health risks when potentially hazardous materials are buried in the soil.   Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer more then 46cm thick where restrictive kind is ""fragipan"", ""duripan"", ""petrocalcic"", ""ortstein"", or ""petrogypsic"" and restrictive feature hardness is not noncemented. If pan thickness is < 46cm then the rating is reduced by half.  Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table.

4.  Too clayey:  This rule evaluates textures from the thickest layers between 30 and 200 cm.  Textures of cl, sicl, sc, sic, and c are rated as too clayey.  If clay minerology is kaolinitic or the soil is in an aridic moisture regime the clay content is not a restrictive feature.  Clayey soils may become sticky when wet and are difficult to spread and compact.  This condition is not restrictive for soil in Aridic moisture regimes and is only partially restrictive when clay mineralogy is kaolinitic. Soil feature considered is the weighted average of clay content between 30 and 200cm or above a restrictive layer and taxonomic family mineralogy.
		
	Property used: CLAY PERCENT IN DEPTH 30-200CM (Modality - representative value)
		
	Restriction limits:

	Null clay contents are assigned to the Not rated class.
 
	AND

	Property used: TAXONOMIC MINERALOGY CLASS (Modality - representative value)
		
	Restriction limits:
		If taxonomic family mineralogy is kaolinitic then
		the soil clayey rating is reduced by multiplying by 0.5.
			
	Null taxonomic mineralogy classes are assigned Not Rated.
	
	
	
	Soil Moisture: clayey soils can be difficult to work when they are moist.  The moisture content of unsaturated soil is time dependent as well as spatially variable.  The spatial variation in the soil moisture is described by the taxonomic soil moisture class.

			IF moisture matches ""perudic"", ""aquic"", ""peraquic"" THEN 1, limiting.
			
			
		Null values are assigned to the limiting class.
		
		
		
		
5.  Unstable Excavation Walls:  Under certain circumstances, the sides of an excavation may collapse.  This can be hazardous to anyone in the trench or near the edge at the time of failure.  The sloughed material may need to be removed from the trench, increasing the time needed to excavate.  The sides of the trench may need to be made to reflect the angle of repose of the material or be shored.
	
	
		A. Instability of the  excavation walls can be caused by the coarseness of the soil material.
		
		Property used: FRAGMENT PERCENT IN DEPTH 30-200CM (Modality - low, high, representative value)

		 B.  High shrink-swell can cause instability of excavation wall.
		 
		 Property used: LEP 25-200cm OR ABOVE RESTRICTIVE LAYER WTD_AVE

6.  Too Sandy: Sandy soils may slump and are droughty, making establishment of vegetative cover difficult.  Soil feature considered is the sand content, minus clay, of the thickest soil layer between 25 and 200cm or above a cemented restrictive layer.  This rule evaluates the weighted average of sand minus clay between 30 and 180 cm.  Textures of LCOS, LS, LFS, LVFS, COS, S, FS, VFS, and SG are rated as too sandy.

	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		= ""occasional"" or ""very frequent"" or ""frequent""

	Null frequency is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	
	
8.  Depth to saturated zone: Soils with shallow depth to a water table may become waterlogged and boggy during periods of heavy precipitation and are slow to drain.

	Property used: PONDING DURATION (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:

				  	  ""long"" or ""very long""
		Not limiting		not = ""very brief"" or ""brief"" or 
				  	      ""long"" or ""very long""
		
	Null duration is assigned to the Not limiting class.
OR
		
	Property used: PONDING FREQUENCY
			(Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Not Limiting	    = ""none""
		Limiting	not = ""none""
		
	Null frequency is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	
	
14.  Rock Outcrop:  Areas that have rock outcrop in the vicinity are not likely to have a sufficiently large area of soil for the facility.  Rock outcrops can interfere with renovation of the leachate from the facility.
        
        Property used: PA ROCK OUTCROP 2(Modality - representative value)
        
        Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		The phase ""rock outcrop"" occurs in the map unit name.
		Not limiting		The phase ""rock outcrop"" does not occur in the map unit name.
		
		
Any soil with a portion or full map unit name of Rock Outcrop is returned as a value of 1 and is given the rating of Rock Outcrop and is considered a limitation.

Any soil with a portion of the map unit name listed as ""rocky"" is returned as a value of .3 and is given the rating of ""Slight Rock Outcrop"".

Any soil with a portion of the map unit name listed as ""very rocky"" is returned as a value of .7 and is given the rating of ""Severe Rock Outcrop"".

All map units have a name, no null data should be encountered.


15.  Salinity: Soils with high salinity have reduced available water capacity, which restrict plan growth and re-establishing vegetation in disturbed area.  Soil feature considered is the highest salinity (electrical conductivity) for all horizons.
		
	Property used: SALINITY MAXIMUM (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		
	Restriction limits:
		Limiting		 > 16 mmhos/cm
		Not limiting		<= 16 mmhos/cm			
		
	Null EC is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	
	
16.  Seepage:  The soil's bottom layer Ksat governs the leaching and seepage potential of the soil.   When this rate is high, transmission of fluids through the soil and underlying materials is unimpeded and leaching and seepage may become environmental, health, and performance concern.  Soil feature considered is the Ksat of the bottom layer or the layer immediately above bedrock.  In areas where seepage is somewhat limiting, a clay liner may be used to lower the transmission rate of the bottom of the pit.  This condition is not restrictive for soil in Aridic moisture regimes.   
	
	Property used: KSAT BOTTOM HORIZON (Modality - high, low, representative value)
			
	Restriction limits:
		Limiting 	 	 => 42.0 micrometers/sec
		Somewhat limiting	 14-42 micrometers/sec

6/15/04 PRF modified the hedge from ""NULL NOT RATED"" to ""NOT NULL AND"".  The Null values were throwing out a ""Not Rated"" that affected the final rating.



17.  Depth to bedrock: Shallow depth to bedrock limits the soil's adsorptive capacity and the thickness of the biologically active zone through with waste materials can percolate.  Shallow soils may pose environmental and health risks when agricultural and municipal waste materials are applied. These soils may pose construction limitations or environmental and health risks when trench landfills are installed. Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restrictive type is ""bedrock (lithic)"" or ""bedrock (paralithic)."" Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table. 

	Property used: DEPTH TO BEDROCK (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Severely Limiting		 < 150cm
                                Somewhat Limiting                    150 - 199 cm
		Not limiting		=> 200cm
		
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.

	Property used: SLOPE (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		
	Restriction limits:
		Limiting		> 15%
		Somewhat limiting	>= 8 and <= 15%
		Not limiting		< 8%			
		
	Null Slope is assigned Not rated.
	
	
	
19.  Sodium content: Soils with high sodium adsorption ratio have the potential to restrict plan growth and re-establishing vegetation in disturbed area. This condition is not restrictive for soil in Aridic moisture regimes.  Soil feature considered is the horizon with the highest sodium adsorption ratio.

		
	Property used: SODIUM ADSORPTION RATIO MAXIMUM (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		
	Restriction limits:
		Limiting		 > 13 
		Not limiting		<= 13 			
		
	Null SAR is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	
	
20.  Water Gathering Surface: Some surfaces are shaped so as to gather water.  This additional water may cause problems for land use.  Soils that are concave up and down their slope and concave across their slope are most strongly water gathering.  Soils that are concave across their slope and linear or convex up and down their slopes are less water collecting.  Soils that are linear across their slopes and concave up and down their slopes are somewhat water collecting.  Soils that are convex up and down their slopes and convex across their slopes are the least water gathering.

Water gathering (concave) surfaces can concentrate water flow and cause accelerated erosion.  Increased costs because of materials and land shaping may be needed to prevent erosion.
		  
		  Property Used: WATER GATHERING SURFACE
		  
		  Restrictive limits:
		    Somewhat Limiting		Concave up-down, concave across surfaces
		    Slightly limiting		Concave across, linear or convex up-down
		    Not limiting		All other surface shapes
		    
		  NOTE!!!  The fuzzy number returned by this rule can not exceed 0.5.
		  
Null slope shape is assigned to the ""Not Rated"" class.



21.  Too acid: Soils with low pH increase metallic ion availability and restricts plant growth and re-establishing vegetation in disturbed area.  Soil feature considered is the minimum (pH) of the soil layers.
	
	Property used: SOIL REACTION 1-1 WATER (Minimum) (Modality - high, low, representative value)
				
	Restriction limits:
		Limiting	 < 3.5
		Not limiting	=> 3.5
			
	Null pH values are assigned to the Not rated class.

22.  Dustiness is a concern for human health as well as aesthetic reasons.  Dust generation from roads is a significant source of inhalable particulate matter.  Two dust particle sizes are recognized: PM10 and PM2.5, relating to particles of aerodynamic diameters of 10 and 2.5 microns, respectively.  The capacity of soils to produce dust particles has been found by Carvacho et al (2004) to be directly related to the clay or silt content of the soil.  Thus, the PM10 or PM2.5 generation capacity of a soil is inversely proportional to its sand content.  Gupsum is also related to dustiness because the soft crystals are relatively easily crushed to silt and clay size particles which can then be picked up by air.

Other major variables in dust generation are moisture content, vehicle size, and the amount of traffic on the road.

The ""Dryness Index"" accounts for the moisture content of the surface.  In a dry, hot environment, the generation of dust is greater than in a cool, moist environment.  Thus dust generation is directly proportional to temperature and inversely proportional to rainfall.

An array of materials is available for overcoming dust limitations (Gebhart et al, 1999).

CO643,"DHS - Catastrophic Mortality, Large Animal Disposal, Pit",limitation,"Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as ""Catastrophic Mortality, Large Animal Disposal, Pit"".  If a soil's property within 200 cm (~79 inches) of the soil surface has a membership index greater than zero, then that soil property is limiting.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership index for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""Catastrophic Mortality, Large Animal Disposal, Pit"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Catastrophic Mortality, Large Animal Disposal, Pit is a method of disposing dead animals by placing the carcasses in successive layers in an excavated pit.  The carcasses are spread, compacted, and covered daily with a thin layer of soil that is excavated from the pit.  When the pit is full, a final cover of soil material at least 2 feet thick is placed over the burial pit.

Scope: National

The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or floodwater.  Potential contamination may be reduced or eliminated by installing systems designed to overcome or reduce the effects of the limiting soil property.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

The estimated land area needed to dispose of mature cattle ranges from 1.2 (McDaniel, 1991) to 3.5 (Ollis, 2002) cubic yards.  A single adult bovine is considered equivalent to 5 sheep or 5 hogs (McDaniel, 1991; USDA, 1980).  Lund et al estimate that about 92,000 cubic yards of volume would be needed to dispose of 30,000 head of cattle, assuming a trench depth of 8.5 feet (which is somewhat below the depth of observation for typical soil survey).  This is about seven acres.  Leachate collection should be considered because the putrefaction of one adult bovine is estimated to release 21 gallons of fluid in the first week and a total of about 42 gallons in the first month (Munroe, 2001).  Collection of gases released during the decomposition process should also be considered. 

Ratings are based on properties and qualities to the depth normally observed during soil mapping (approximately 6 or 7 feet).  However, because pits may be as deep as 15 feet or more, geologic investigations are needed to determine the potential for pollution of ground water as well as to determine the design needed.  These investigations, which are generally arranged by the pit developer, include the examination of stratification, rock formations, and geologic conditions that might lead to the conducting of leachates to aquifers, wells, watercourses, and other water sources.  The presence of hard, nonrippable bedrock, bedrock crevices, or highly permeable strata in or immediately underlying the proposed pit bottom is undesirable because of the difficulty in excavation and the potential pollution of underground water.

Properties that influence the risk of pollution, ease of excavation, trafficability, and revegetation are major considerations.  Soils that flood or have a water table within the depth of excavation present a potential pollution hazard and are difficult to excavate.  Slope is an important consideration because it affects the work involved in road construction, the performance of the roads, and the control of surface water around the pit.  It may also cause difficulty in constructing pits for which the pit bottom must be kept level and oriented to follow the contour.

The ease with which the pit is dug and with which a soil can be used as daily and final covers is based largely on texture and consistence of the soil.  The texture and consistence of a soil determine the degree of workability of the soil both when dry and when wet.  Soils that are plastic and sticky when wet are difficult to excavate, grade, or compact and difficult to place as a uniformly thick cover over a layer of carcasses.  The uppermost part of the final cover should be soil material that is favorable for the growth of plants.  It should not contain excess sodium or salt and should not be too acid.  In comparison with other horizons, the A horizon in most soils has the best workability and the highest content of organic matter.  Thus, for a Large Animal Disposal, Pit operation it may be desirable to stockpile the surface layer for use in the final blanketing of the filled pit area.

Criteria used:

1.  Adsorption:  Soils having a low cec or ecec may not attenuate biohazardous material from the decay process.  It is assumed that the upper 25 cm of the site will be stockpiled for use in revegetating the site.  It is also assumed that alternating layers of soil and biological materials will be placed in the excavation.

Soils having low CEC or ECEC are not able to retain some leachates.  A soil is a full member of the set of soils having low adsorption if the CEC or ECEC to clay ratio is below 0.05, a partial member between 0.05 and 0.15, and a nonmember if the cec or ecec to clay ratio is over 0.150.
	
	Property used: CLAY ACTIVITY IN DEPTH 30-200cm (Modality - low, high, representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		Below 0.05 meq/100g
		Somewhat limiting	0.05-0.15 meq/100g
		Not limiting		> 0.15 meq/100g
		
	The fuzzy number is weighted by 0.25, meaning this rule cannot cause the component to be absolutely true that the site is limited for the intended land use.

			
Null clay activity is assigned to the ""Not Rated"" class.

2.  Porous bedrock: Limestone bedrock (and other types) may have numerous solution channels that allow contaminants to enter the groundwater quickly and with no renovation.  The porous nature of the bedrock is often reflected by ""karst"" phases of map units.  Deeper soils will tend to lessen the risk of contamination.

	  Evaluation used: BEDROCK IS LIMESTONE

		  
	  Property used: LIMESTONE RESIDUUM TEST, NULL SENDS NO
		  
	  Restrictive Limits:
	    Limiting		If the bedrock is limestone, the site is limited by the bedrock type.
	    Not limiting	If the bedrock is not limestone, the site is not limited by the bedrock type.
		    
		    
	  NOTE!!!  As the property is now written, if bedrock is not populated, a N0 is returned.
	  NOTE!!!  This base rule will be expanded to evaluate more types of bedrock.

3.  Depth to thick/thin cemented pan: Depth to thick or thin cemented pan may pose construction limitations or environmental and health risks when potentially hazardous materials are buried in the soil.   Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer more then 46cm thick where restrictive kind is ""fragipan"", ""duripan"", ""petrocalcic"", ""ortstein"", or ""petrogypsic"" and restrictive feature hardness is not noncemented. If pan thickness is < 46cm then the rating is reduced by half.  Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table.

4.  Too clayey:  This rule evaluates textures from the thickest layers between 30 and 200 cm.  Textures of cl, sicl, sc, sic, and c are rated as too clayey.  If clay minerology is kaolinitic or the soil is in an aridic moisture regime the clay content is not a restrictive feature.  Clayey soils may become sticky when wet and are difficult to spread and compact.  This condition is not restrictive for soil in Aridic moisture regimes and is only partially restrictive when clay mineralogy is kaolinitic. Soil feature considered is the weighted average of clay content between 30 and 200cm or above a restrictive layer and taxonomic family mineralogy.
		
	Property used: CLAY PERCENT IN DEPTH 30-200CM (Modality - representative value)

	Restriction limits:
		If taxonomic family mineralogy is kaolinitic then
		the soil clayey rating is reduced by multiplying by 0.5.
			
	Null taxonomic mineralogy classes are assigned Not Rated.
	
	
	
	Soil Moisture: clayey soils can be difficult to work when they are moist.  The moisture content of unsaturated soil is time dependent as well as spatially variable.  The spatial variation in the soil moisture is described by the taxonomic soil moisture class.

5.  Unstable Excavation Walls:  Under certain circumstances, the sides of an excavation may collapse.  This can be hazardous to anyone in the trench or near the edge at the time of failure.  The sloughed material may need to be removed from the trench, increasing the time needed to excavate.  The sides of the trench may need to be made to reflect the angle of repose of the material or be shored.
	
	
		A. Instability of the excavation walls can be caused by the coarseness of the soil material.

Soil feature considered is the sand content, minus clay, of the thickest soil layer between 25 and 200cm or above a cemented restrictive layer.  This rule evaluates the weighted average of sand minus clay between 30 and 180 cm.  Textures of LCOS, LS, LFS, LVFS, COS, S, FS, VFS, and SG are rated as too sandy.

	Null frequency is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	
	
14.  Rock Outcrop:  Areas that have rock outcrop in the vicinity are not likely to have a sufficiently large area of soil for the facility.  Rock outcrops can interfere with renovation of the leachate from the facility.
        
        Property used: PA ROCK OUTCROP 2(Modality - representative value)
        
        Restrictive limits:

All map units have a name, no null data should be encountered.


15.  Salinity: Soils with high salinity have reduced available water capacity, which restrict plan growth and re-establishing vegetation in disturbed area.  Soil feature considered is the highest salinity (electrical conductivity) for all horizons.
		
	Property used: SALINITY MAXIMUM (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		
	Restriction limits:
		Limiting		 > 16 mmhos/cm
		Not limiting		<= 16 mmhos/cm			
		
	Null EC is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	
	
16.  Seepage:  The soil's bottom layer Ksat governs the leaching and seepage potential of the soil.   When this rate is high, transmission of fluids through the soil and underlying materials is unimpeded and leaching and seepage may become environmental, health, and performance concern.  Soil feature considered is the Ksat of the bottom layer or the layer immediately above bedrock.  In areas where seepage is somewhat limiting, a clay liner may be used to lower the transmission rate of the bottom of the pit.

17.  Depth to bedrock: Shallow depth to bedrock limits the soil's adsorptive capacity and the thickness of the biologically active zone through with waste materials can percolate.  Shallow soils may pose environmental and health risks when agricultural and municipal waste materials are applied. These soils may pose construction limitations or environmental and health risks when trench landfills are installed. Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restrictive type is ""bedrock (lithic)"" or ""bedrock (paralithic)."" Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table. 

	Property used: DEPTH TO BEDROCK (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Severely Limiting		 < 150cm
                                Somewhat Limiting                   150 - 199 cm
		Not limiting		=> 200cm
		
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.

		Not limiting		< 5%			
		
	Null Slope is assigned Not rated.
	
	
	
19.  Sodium content: Soils with high sodium adsorption ratio have the potential to restrict plan growth and re-establishing vegetation in disturbed area.

	Property used: SODIUM ADSORPTION RATIO MAXIMUM (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		
	Restriction limits:

		Not limiting		<= 13 			
		
	Null SAR is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	
	
20.  Water Gathering Surface: Some surfaces are shaped so as to gather water.  This additional water may cause problems for land use.  Soils that are concave up and down their slope and concave across their slope are most strongly water gathering.  Soils that are concave across their slope and linear or convex up and down their slopes are less water collecting.  Soils that are linear across their slopes and concave up and down their slopes are somewhat water collecting.  Soils that are convex up and down their slopes and convex across their slopes are the least water gathering.

Water gathering (concave) surfaces can concentrate water flow and cause accelerated erosion.  Increased costs because of materials and land shaping may be needed to prevent erosion.
		  
		  Property Used: WATER GATHERING SURFACE
		  
		  Restrictive limits:
		    Somewhat Limiting		Concave up-down, concave across surfaces
		    Slightly limiting		Concave across, linear or convex up-down
		    Not limiting		All other surface shapes
		    
		  NOTE!!!  The fuzzy number returned by this rule can not exceed 0.5.
		  
Null slope shape is assigned to the ""Not Rated"" class.



21.  Too acid: Soils with low pH increase metallic ion availability and restricts plant growth and re-establishing vegetation in disturbed area.  Soil feature considered is the minimum (pH) of the soil layers.
	
	Property used: SOIL REACTION 1-1 WATER (Minimum) (Modality - high, low, representative value)
				
	Restriction limits:
		Limiting	 < 3.5
		Not limiting	=> 3.5
			
	Null pH values are assigned to the Not rated class.

22.  Dustiness is a concern for human health as well as aesthetic reasons.  Dust generation from roads is a significant source of inhalable particulate matter.  Two dust particle sizes are recognized: PM10 and PM2.5, relating to particles of aerodynamic diameters of 10 and 2.5 microns, respectively.  The capacity of soils to produce dust particles has been found by Carvacho et al (2004) to be directly related to the clay or silt content of the soil.  Thus, the PM10 or PM2.5 generation capacity of a soil is inversely proportional to its sand content.  Gypsum is also related to dustiness because the soft crystals are relatively easily crushed to silt and clay size particles which can then be picked up by air.

Other major variables in dust generation are moisture content, vehicle size, time of year, and the amount of working of the soil at the site.

The ""Dryness Index"" accounts for the moisture content of the surface.  In a dry, hot environment, the generation of dust is greater than in a cool, moist environment.  Thus dust generation is directly proportional to temperature and inversely proportional to rainfall.

An array of materials is available for overcoming dust limitations (Gebhart et al, 1999).

CO643,AWM - Slow Rate Process Treatment of Wastewater,limitation,"Summary:

Soil interpretations for waste management provide a means to use organic wastes and wastewater as productive resources.  Using these resources will result in energy conservation, prevent waste, and minimize problems associated with their disposal.  The planned use of many wastes has proven beneficial to the producer and the user of these by-products.  The characteristics of the soil are important in the application of organic wastes and wastewater to land for fertilization and irrigation.  They are also important considerations if the soil is used as a medium for the treatment and disposal of these wastes.  Favorable soil properties are required to prevent environmental damage.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Slow Rate Process Treatment of Wastewater"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Slow Rate Process Treatment of Wastewater"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

In this process wastewater is applied to the land at a rate normally between 0.5 and 4.0 inches per week.  The primary purpose is wastewater treatment rather than irrigation of crops.  Application rates commonly exceed those needed for supplemental irrigation for crop production.  The applied wastewater is treated as it moves through the soil.  Much of the treated water percolates to the ground water and some enter the atmosphere by evapotranspiration.  Surface runoff of the applied water generally is not allowed.  Water-logging is avoided either through control of the application rate or the use of tile drains, or both.

The wastewater considered includes municipal wastewater and effluent from food-processing plants, lagoons, and storage ponds.  Municipal wastewater is the waste stream from a municipality.  It contains domestic waste and possibly industrial waste.  It may be, although rarely is, untreated sewage or may be wastewater that has received primary or secondary treatment.  Food-processing wastewater is the wastewater resulting from the preparation of fruits, vegetables, milk, cheese, and meats for public consumption.  In some places, it is high in sodium and chloride.  Lagoon and storage pond effluents, as discussed here, refer to the effluents from a facility used to treat or store food-processing wastewater, domestic wastes, or animal wastes.  Domestic and food-processing wastewater is very dilute, and the effluent from facilities that treat or store it commonly is very low in carbonaceous and nitrogenous matter.  The nitrogen content ranges from 10 to 30 mg/l.  Lagoons or storage ponds for animal wastes have an effluent that has a much higher concentration of these materials mainly because the manure has not been diluted as much as domestic wastes.  The nitrogen content varies considerably but generally is 50 to 2,000 mg/l.  The heavy metal content generally is low; however, chemical analyses should be made prior to use.

The soil-rating guide is based on the treatment of the wastewater and not utilizing wastewater for irrigating of crops.  Vegetation is not a necessary part of the treatment design or process but the basin may be vegetated.  However, it is assumed that crops are grown or may be grown as a part of the soil-plant treatment process.  Checks should be made to ensure that heavy metals and nitrogen are not added in excessive amounts.

Soil properties and qualities considered in rating the degree of limitation are those that affect soil absorption, plant growth, microbial activity, the susceptibility to wind or water erosion, and the application of wastes.  Properties and qualities that affect absorption are the sodium adsorption ratio, depth to a seasonal high water table, the available water capacity, permeability, depth to bedrock or to a cemented pan, soil reaction, cation exchange capacity, and slope.  Soil reaction, the sodium adsorption ratio, salinity, and bulk density are soil properties that affect plant growth and microbial activity.  Wind erodibility group, erosion factor, slope, and susceptibility to flooding are used to measure the potential for wind erosion and water erosion.  Stones can interfere with the application of wastes.  Permanently frozen soils are not suited to treating wastewater.

CO643,AWM - Rapid Infiltration Disposal of Wastewater,limitation,"Summary:

Soil interpretations for waste management provide a means to use organic wastes and wastewater as productive resources.  Using these resources will result in energy conservation, prevent waste, and minimize problems associated with their disposal.  The planned use of many wastes has proven beneficial to the producer and the user of these by-products.  The characteristics of the soil are important in the application of organic wastes and wastewater to land for fertilization and irrigation.  They are also important considerations if the soil is used as a medium for the treatment and disposal of these wastes.  Favorable soil properties are required to prevent environmental damage.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Rapid Infiltration Disposal of Wastewater"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Rapid Infiltration Disposal of Wastewater"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

In this process, the wastewater is applied in a level basin and percolates through the soil.  The treated water eventually reaches the ground water.  Application rates range from 4 to 120 inches per week.

The wastewater considered generally is from municipal wastewater treatment plants.  The nitrogen content generally is low.  Normally, the heavy metal content is low; however, chemical analysis should be made prior to use.  Because the thickness of soil material needed for proper renovation of the wastewater is more than 72 inches, geologic and hydrologic investigations during the planning stages.  This information is needed to ensure proper design and to determine reliability of performance as well as the potential for pollution of the ground water.

Depth to a seasonal high water table, flooding, and depth to bedrock or to a cemented pan present potential hazards and influence design and construction.

It contains domestic waste and possibly industrial waste.  It may be, although rarely is, raw sewage (untreated), or it may be wastewater that has received primary or secondary treatment.  Food-processing wastewater is the wastewater resulting from the preparation of fruits, vegetables, milk, cheese, and meats for public consumption.  In some places, it is high in sodium and chloride.  Lagoon and storage pond effluents, as discussed here, refer to the effluents from a lagoon or storage pond that is used to treat or store food-processing wastewater, domestic wastes, or animal wastes.  Domestic wastes are very dilute, and the effluent from a facility that treats them commonly is very low in carbonaceous and nitrogenous matter.  The nitrogen content ranges from 10 to 30 mg/l.  Lagoons and storage ponds that treat animal wastes have an effluent that has a much higher concentration of these materials mainly because the manure has not been diluted as much as domestic wastes.  The nitrogen content varies considerably but generally is 50 to 2,000 mg/l.  The heavy metal content generally is low; however, chemical analyses should be made prior to use.

In this process, wastewater is applied to the upper reaches of sloped land and allowed to flow across vegetated surfaces that are sometimes called terraces, to runoff collection ditches.  The length of the run generally is 150 to 300 feet.  Application rates range from 2.5 to 16.0 inches per week.  The wastewater leaves solids and nutrients to plants and soil surfaces as it flows downslope in a thin film.  Most of the water reaches the collection ditch, some is lost by evapotranspiration, and a small part percolates to the ground water.

Scope: National

The soil-rating guide is based on the treatment of the wastewater and not utilizing wastewater for irrigating of crops.  However, areas are vegetated because plants are a necessary part of the soil-plant treatment process.  Wastewater generally is applied by sprinkler or surface application methods.

Soil properties and qualities considered in rating the degree of limitation are those that affect absorption, plant growth, microbial activity, and the design and construction of site.  The properties that affect adsorption are soil reaction and the cation exchange capacity.  Soil reaction, salinity, and the sodium adsorption ratio are soil properties that affect plant growth and microbial activity.  Slope, permeability within a depth of about 30 inches, depth to a seasonal high water table, flooding, depth to bedrock or to a cemented pan, and stones are soil properties and qualities that influence design and construction.  Permanently frozen soils are not suited to treating wastewater.

	17.  Subsidence due to gypsum:  Addition of water in excess of evapotranspiration may cause dissolution and removal of soluble soil material.  Eventually, voids will form in the soil which will manifested at the surface as depressions.  These will collect water which will cause uneven distribution of irrigation water and exacerbate the dissolution problem.  Subsidence is estimated from the gypsum content of the soil.  Other soluble salts may also contribute to the loss of volume of the soil.  

Assumptions:

		* Differential subsidence is assumed to always occur, rather than an equidimensional settling.
		* Water as irrigation, leakage, septic systems, or whatever is assumed to be applied.  If no water is added to the soil, no dissolution 				occurs and therefore no subsidence.
		* Dissolution kinetics are assumed to be such that the settling is observable in our lifetimes.
		* The size of the structure has an influence on the tolerable amount of distortion due to settling.
		* The age of the structure influences the amount of damage it will sustain if differential subsidence occurs.
		* The particle size of the gypsum will influence the dissolution rate.  A generic rate is assumed here.

CO643,AWM - Manure and Food Processing Waste,limitation,"Summary:

Soil interpretations for waste management provide a means to use organic wastes and wastewater as productive resources.  Using these resources will result in energy conservation, prevent waste, and minimize problems associated with their disposal.  The planned use of many wastes has proven beneficial to the producer and the user of these by-products.  The characteristics of the soil are important in the application of organic wastes and wastewater to land for fertilization and irrigation.  They are also important considerations if the soil is used as a medium for the treatment and disposal of these wastes.  Favorable soil properties are required to prevent environmental damage.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Manure and Food Processing Waste"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Manure and Food Processing Waste"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Manure is the excrement of livestock and poultry.  The consistency of manure is labile.  It changes in storage or treatment, and it depends upon the bedding used and upon whether the manure is diluted or allowed to dry.  Food processing wastes consist of damaged fruit and vegetables and the peelings, stems, leaves, pits, and soil particles removed in food preparation.  Most wastes produced in the processing of milk, cheese, and meat are liquids.  Paunch manure is an exception.

Manure and food processing wastes have variable nitrogen content.  The material is solid, slurry, or liquid.  A high nitrogen content limits the application rate.  Toxic or otherwise dangerous wastes, such as those mixed with the lye used in food processing, are outside the meaning of manure and food processing wastes as used in this interpretation.

Scope: National

The soil rating guide is based on utilizing the nutrients in the wastes for crop production and is not directed toward reclaiming or restoring critical areas or making the most efficient use of moisture.  Applications of liquid wastes can be made by tank wagon or conventional irrigation methods that are modified as necessary to function properly.  Applications of solid and slurry wastes can be made at the surface or subsurface.

This interpretive rule uses the criteria published in the AGRICULTURAL WASTE MANAGEMENT FIELD HANDBOOK (Part 651), Engineering Division, Natural Resources Conservation Service, USDA.

Soil properties and qualities considered are those that affect soil absorption, plant growth, microbial activity, the susceptibility to wind or water erosion, and the rate and method of the application of wastes.  Soil properties that affect absorption are permeability, the depth to a seasonal high water table, sodium adsorption ratio, the depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, and the available water capacity.  Soil reaction, sodium adsorption ratio, salinity, and bulk density are soil properties that affect plant growth and microbial activity.  The wind erodibility group, erosion factor, slopes, and susceptibility to flooding are used to measure the potential for wind and water erosion. Stones and the depth to a seasonal high water table can interfere with the application of wastes.  Permanently frozen soils are not suited to the treatment of wastes.

CO643,AWM - Land Application of Municipal Sewage Sludge,limitation,"Summary:

Soil interpretations for waste management provide a means to use organic wastes and wastewater as productive resources.  Using these resources will result in energy conservation, prevent waste, and minimize problems associated with their disposal.  The planned use of many wastes has proven beneficial to the producer and the user of these by-products.  The characteristics of the soil are important in the application of organic wastes and wastewater to land for fertilization and irrigation.  They are also important considerations if the soil is used as a medium for the treatment and disposal of these wastes.  Favorable soil properties are required to prevent environmental damage.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Land Application of Municipal Sewage Sludge"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Land Application of Municipal Sewage Sludge"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Municipal sewage sludge is the residual product of the treatment of municipal sewage.  The solid component is composed mainly of cell mass, primarily bacteria cells which have developed during secondary treatment and which have incorporated soluble organic into their own bodies.  Sludge also contains small amounts of sand, silt, and other solid debris.

The water content of sludge ranges from about 98 percent to about 40 percent or less.  The sludge is called liquid if it is more than about 90 percent water, slurry if it is about 90 to 50 percent water, and solid if it is less than about 50 percent water.  Depending on the water content, the sludge can be moved by pump, conveyor, or auger.

Municipal sewage sludges have a variable nitrogen content.  Some sludge contains constituents that are toxic to plant growth or hazardous to the food chain (such as heavy metals or exotic organic compounds) and should be chemically analyzed prior to use.

Scope: National

The soil-rating guide is based on utilizing the nutrients in the waste for crop production and is not directed toward reclaiming or restoring critical areas or making the most efficient use of moisture.  Applications of slurry sludge can be by tank wagon or by irrigation equipment that is modified as necessary to function properly.  Applications of solid and slurry sludges can be made at the surface or subsurface.

The soil properties and qualities considered in the ratings are those that affect soil absorption, plant growth, microbial activity, the susceptibility to wind or water erosion, and the rate and method of application.  Soil properties and qualities that affect absorption are permeability, the depth to a seasonal high water table, soil reaction, sodium adsorption ratio, salinity, and bulk density.  They also affect plant growth and microbial activity.  Slope and the susceptibility to flooding are used to measure the potential for water erosion.  Stones and the depth to a seasonal high water table can interfere with the application of wastes.  Permanently frozen soils are not suited to the treatment of wastes.

Description:

The wastewater considered in this guide is municipal wastewater and wastewater from food processing plants, lagoons, and storage ponds.  Municipal wastewater contains domestic waste and, in some areas, includes industrial waste.  It may be untreated, although this is rare, or wastewater may have received primary or secondary treatment.  Food processing wastewater is the wastewater resulting from the preparation of fruits, vegetables, milk, cheese, and meats for public consumption.  In some places, it has a high content of sodium and chloride.  Lagoon and storage pond effluent, as discussed in this guide, refer to the effluent from facilities used to treat or store domestic wastes, wastewater from food processing, or liquid animal wastes.  The effluent from a municipal or food processing plant lagoon or storage pond commonly is very low in carbonaceous and nitrogenous matter.  The nitrogen content ranges from 10 to 30 mg/l.  The effluent from animal waste treatment lagoons or storage ponds have much higher concentrations of these materials mainly because the manure has not been diluted as much as domestic wastes.  The nitrogen content varies considerably but generally is from 50 to 2,000 mg/l.  Ratings are based on the influence of existing soil properties on the use.

Scope: National

Some wastewater may cause an increase in sodicity or salinity in the soils in arid and semiarid regions but it generally does not in humid regions.  The heavy metal contents of effluents are usually low; however, chemical analyses should be made prior to use.

The soil properties and qualities need to be considered in the design, construction, management, and performance of wastewater irrigation systems.  The soil properties and qualities important in design and management are the sodium adsorption ratio, depth to a seasonal high water table, the available water capacity, permeability, wind erodibility, erosion factor, slope, and flooding.  The soil properties and qualities that influence construction are stones, depth to bedrock or cemented pan, and depth to a seasonal high water table.  The properties and qualities that affect performance of the irrigation system are depth to bedrock or to a cemented pan, bulk density, the sodium adsorption ratio, salinity, and soil reaction.  The cation exchange capacity also affects performance, and it is used here as an estimate of the capacity of a soil to adsorb heavy metals.  Permanently frozen soils are not suited to irrigation.  Soils having porous bedrock can be limited by rapid water movement into and through the bedrock.  Soils having high contents of soluble salts can experience subsidence.

The soil rating guide is based on the utilization of the water for crop production and is not directed toward only the disposal or treatment of the wastewater.  Checks should be made to ensure that heavy metals, nitrogen, and other salts are not added in excessive amounts.

	19.  Addition of water in excess of evapotranspiration may cause dissolution and removal of soluble soil material.  Eventually, voids will form in the soil which will manifested at the surface as depressions.  These will collect water which will cause uneven distribution of irrigation water and exacerbate the dissolution problem.  Subsidence is estimated from the gypsum content of the soil.  Other soluble salts may also contribute to the loss of volume of the soil.  

Assumptions:

		* Differential subsidence is assumed to always occur, rather than an equidimensional settling.
		* Water as irrigation, leakage, septic systems, or whatever is assumed to be applied.  If no water is added to the soil, no dissolution 				occurs and therefore no subsidence.
		* Dissolution kinetics are assumed to be such that the settling is observable in our lifetimes.
		* The size of the structure has an influence on the tolerable amount of distortion due to settling.
		* The age of the structure influences the amount of damage it will sustain if differential subsidence occurs.
		* The particle size of the gypsum will influence the dissolution rate.  A generic rate is assumed here.

CO643,MIL - Trafficability Veh. Type 5 dry season (DOD),suitability,"MIL - Trafficability Veh. Type 5 dry season

Summary:  Military category type-5 vehicles are most all-wheel-drive trucks, a great number of trailed vehicles, and heavy tanks.  Soils trafficability during the dry season is the capacity of soils to support vehicles in category type 5.  Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data such as topography and soil data and weather conditions.  The Military Trafficability interpretations are base on procedures and criteria contained Army Field Manual - 5-430-00-1; Chapter Seven and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning.  Commanders and engineers must be cautious as the interpreted results can vary greatly.

The trafficability of fine-grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine-grained material to behave like fine-grained soils is more difficult to assess than trafficability in coarse-grained soils (clean sands).  Relationships that describe the soil-vehicle interactions are based on soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large surface stones, and slope are the basis for soil trafficability interpretations.

Rating classes ""Excellent,"" ""Good"", ""Fair"", or ""Poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic and considers soil features that affect trafficability.  An ""Excellent"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that do not limit trafficability and have very low maintenance.  A ""Good"" rating indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use.  Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  A ""Fair"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.  A ""Poor"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use.  Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management.  Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Scope:  The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or man-made obstacles (such as forests or ditches) nor information on vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning).  These interpretations are developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subjected to freeze-thaw cycles, if they are not frozen at the time of traffic.

Trafficability performances were estimated for a minimum number of vehicle passes (1) or a maximum of 50 vehicles in the same ruts.  Today most relations are used for one pass and the combined effects on vehicle performance of terrain features such as soil, vegetation, and slope can only accurately be determined using the computerized Army mobility prediction system contained in the NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM).  The engineering relationships that produce vehicle speed predictions or GO/NO GO performance based on measured terrain and vehicle characteristics are contained in the NRMM.

Description:  Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and unified class are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability.  For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under repeated traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are unified class and their relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness.

Scope:  The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or man-made obstacles (such as forests or ditches) nor information on vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning).  These interpretations are developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subjected to freeze-thaw cycles, if they are not frozen at the time of traffic.

Trafficability performances were estimated for 50 vehicle passes in the same ruts.  Today most relations are used for one pass and the combined effects on vehicle performance of terrain features such as soil, vegetation, and slope can only accurately be determined using the computerized Army mobility prediction system contained in the NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM).  The engineering relationships that produce vehicle speed predictions or GO/NO GO performance based on measured terrain and vehicle characteristics are contained in the NRMM.

Description:  Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and unified class are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability.  For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under repeated traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are unified class and their relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness.

CO643,MIL - Trafficability Veh. Type 6 dry season (DOD),suitability,"MIL - Trafficability Veh. Type 6 dry season

Summary:  Military category type-6 vehicles are a great number of all-wheel-drive and rear-wheel-drive trucks and trailed vehicles intended primarily for highway use.  Soils trafficability during the dry season is the capacity of soils to support vehicles in category type 6.  Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data such as topography and soil data and weather conditions.  The Military Trafficability interpretations are base on procedures and criteria contained Army Field Manual - 5-430-00-1; Chapter Seven and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning.  Commanders and engineers must be cautious as the interpreted results can vary greatly.

The trafficability of fine-grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine-grained material to behave like fine-grained soils is more difficult to assess than trafficability in coarse-grained soils (clean sands).  Relationships that describe the soil-vehicle interactions are based on soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large surface stones, and slope are the basis for soil trafficability interpretations.

Rating classes ""Excellent,"" ""Good"", ""Fair"", or ""Poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic and considers soil features that affect trafficability.  An ""Excellent"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that do not limit trafficability and have very low maintenance.  A ""Good"" rating indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use.  Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  A ""Fair"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.  A ""Poor"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use.  Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management.  Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Summary:  Military category type-7 vehicles are rear-wheel-drive vehicles and others that generally are not expected to operate off road, especially in wet soils.  Soils trafficability during the wet season is the capacity of soils to support vehicles in category type 7.  Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data such as topography and soil data and weather conditions.  The Military Trafficability interpretations are base on procedures and criteria contained Army Field Manual - 5-430-00-1; Chapter Seven and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning.  Commanders and engineers must be cautious as the interpreted results can vary greatly.

The trafficability of fine-grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine-grained material to behave like fine-grained soils when wet is more difficult to assess than trafficability in coarse-grained soils (clean sands).  Relationships that describe the soil-vehicle interactions are based on soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large surface stones, and slope are the basis for soil trafficability interpretations.

Rating classes ""Excellent,"" ""Good"", ""Fair"", or ""Poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic and considers soil features that affect trafficability.  An ""Excellent"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that do not limit trafficability and have very low maintenance.  A ""Good"" rating indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use.  Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  A ""Fair"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.  A ""Poor"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use.  Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management.  Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Scope:  The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or man-made obstacles (such as forests or ditches) nor information on vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning).  These interpretations are developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subjected to freeze-thaw cycles, if they are not frozen at the time of traffic.

Trafficability performances were estimated for 50 vehicle passes in the same ruts.  Today most relations are used for one pass and the combined effects on vehicle performance of terrain features such as soil, vegetation, and slope can only accurately be determined using the computerized Army mobility prediction system contained in the NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM).  The engineering relationships that produce vehicle speed predictions or GO/NO GO performance based on measured terrain and vehicle characteristics are contained in the NRMM.

Description:  Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and unified class are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability.  For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under repeated traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are unified class and their relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness.

CO643,Soil Susceptibility to Compaction,limitation,"Soil Susceptibility to Compaction

Soils can be a full member, partial member, or non-member of the set of soils that are susceptible to compaction.  Soils are rated based on their susceptibility to compaction from the operation of ground-based equipment for planting, harvesting, and site preparation activities when soils are moist.  Soil compaction is the process in which soil particles are pressed together more closely that in the original state.  Typically, the soil must be moist to be compacted because the mineral grains must slide together.  Compaction reduces the abundance mostly of large pores in the soil by damaging the structure of the soil.  This produces several effects that are unwanted in agricultural soils since large pores are most effective at transmitting water and air through the soil.  Compaction also increases the soil strength which can limit root penetration and growth.  The ability of soil to hold water is adversely affected by compaction since the large pores hold water.  The degree of compaction of a soil is measured by its bulk density, which is the mass per volume, generally expressed in grams per cubic centimeter.

Compacted soils are less favorable for good plant growth because of high soil bulk density and hardness, reduced pore space, and poor aeration and drainage. Root penetration and growth is decreased in compacted soils because the hardness or strength of these soils prevents the expansion of roots. Supplies of air, water, and nutrients that roots need are also less favorable when compaction decreases soil porosity and drainage.

Interpretation ratings are based on soil properties in the upper 12 inches of the profile.  Factors considered are soil texture, soil organic matter content, soil structure, rock fragment content, and the existing bulk density.  Each of these is thought to contribute to resisting the susceptibility of a soil to compaction when present.  Organic matter in the soil provides resistance to compaction and the resilience to ameliorate the effects with time.  Soil structure adds strength as discrete aggregates and it is the aggregates that are deformed or destroyed by compactive forces, thus strong soil structure lowers the susceptibility to compaction.  Similarly, rock fragments in the soil can bridge and provide a framework to resist compaction.  Finally, if a soil is already fairly dense causing further compaction is more difficult. 

Definitions of the ratings:

Low - The potential for compaction is insignificant.  This soil is able to support standard equipment with minimal compaction. The soil is moisture insensitive, exhibiting only small changes in density with changing moisture content.

Medium - The potential for compaction is significant.  The growth rate of seedlings may be reduced following compaction.  After the initial compaction (i.e., the first equipment pass), this soil is able to support standard equipment with only minimal increases in soil density.  The soil is intermediate between moisture insensitive and moisture sensitive.

High - The potential for compaction is significant.  The growth rate of seedlings will be reduced following compaction.  After initial compaction, this soil is still able to support standard equipment, but will continue to compact with each subsequent pass.  The soil is moisture sensitive, exhibiting large changes in density with changing moisture content.

CO643,URB/REC - Camp Areas,limitation,"Summary:

Soil interpretations for recreational development are to be used to guide the user in identifying and evaluating the suitability of the soil for specific recreational purposes.  The soil survey interpretation rating guides are applicable to both heavily and sparsely populated areas, depending upon the objectives of the user.  The ratings are for soils in their present condition and do not consider present land use.  These ratings do not consider location and accessibility of the area, size and shape of the area, scenic quality, the ability of the soil to support vegetation, access to water or potential sites for water impoundment.  Nor do the ratings consider access to public sewers or the capacity of the soil to support localized sanitary facilities such as septic tank adsorption fields or sanitary landfills.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Camp Areas"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Camp Areas"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Camp areas are tracts of land used intensively as sites for tents, trailers, campers, and the accompanying activities of outdoor living.  Camp areas require site preparation such as shaping and leveling in the areas used for tents and parking areas, stabilizing roads and intensively used areas, and installing sanitary facilities and utility lines.  Camp areas are subject to heavy foot traffic and some vehicular traffic.

Many soil survey areas in sparsely populated parts of the country have soil surveys of lower intensity.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.

Scope: National

Soil properties and qualities considered in rating the degree of limitation are those that influence the ease of developing camping areas and the performance of the camping area after development.  Soil properties that influence trafficability and promote the growth of vegetation after heavy use are important.  For tent or remote campsites, the limitations would be less restrictive.

Slope, stoniness, and depth to bedrock or cemented pans are the main concerns in developing camp areas.  However, areas associated with picnic areas may have steep slopes and rough terrain for aesthetic purposes.  For good trafficability, the surface of camp areas should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under heavy foot traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence trafficability are texture of the surface layer, wetness, permeability, and large stones.  The limitations of slow permeability and clayey surface texture are not as severe in dry regions of the country; however, silty soils may be more of a problem because they are dusty.  Soil properties that influence the growth of plants are depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, permeability, and presence of toxic materials.  Soils that are subject to flooding are particularly hazardous for camp areas because of the danger to life and property.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

CO643,URB/REC - Off-Road Motorcycle Trails,limitation,"Summary:

Soil interpretations for recreational development are to be used to guide the user in identifying and evaluating the suitability of the soil for specific recreational purposes.  The soil survey interpretation rating guides are applicable to both heavily and sparsely populated areas, depending upon the objectives of the user.  The ratings are for soils in their present condition and do not consider present land use.  These ratings do not consider location and accessibility of the area, size and shape of the area, scenic quality, the ability of the soil to support vegetation, access to water or potential sites for water impoundment.  Nor do the ratings consider access to public sewers or the capacity of the soil to support localized sanitary facilities such as septic tank adsorption fields or sanitary landfills.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Off-Road Motorcycle Trails"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Off-Road Motorcycle Trails"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Off-road motorcycle trails are primarily for recreational use.  Trails for other off-road vehicles may have similar criteria.  Little or no preparation is done to the trail, and the surface is not vegetated or surfaced.  Considerable compaction of the soil on the trail is expected.

Many soil survey areas in sparsely populated parts of the country have soil surveys of lower intensity.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.

Scope: National

Soil properties and qualities considered in rating the degree of limitation are those that influence the ease of developing off-road motorcycle trails and the performance of off-road motorcycle trails after development.  Erodibility, revegetation, trafficability, and dustiness are the main concerns in developing paths and trails.  For good trafficability, the surface of a path or trail should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under heavy traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Considerations for desirable off-road challenges are not included.

Soil properties considered are stoniness, slope, wetness, texture of the surface layer, and flooding.  Slope affects the soil erodibility.  Large stones affect the configuration of the trail.  Small stones affect trafficability.  Wetness and flooding affect revegetation and frequency of use.  Surface texture affects erodibility, trafficability, revegetation, and probability of dust.

14.  Dust - Dustiness is a concern for human health as well as aesthetic reasons.  Dust generation from roads is a significant source of inhalable particulate matter.  Two dust particle sizes are recognized: PM10 and PM2.5, relating to particles of aerodynamic diameters of 10 and 2.5 microns, respectively.  The capacity of soils to produce dust particles has been found by Carvacho et al (2004) to be directly related to the clay or silt content of the soil.  Thus, the PM10 or PM2.5 generation capacity of a soil is inversely proportional to its sand content.  Gypsum is also related to dustiness because the soft crystals are relatively easily crushed to silt and clay size particles which can then be picked up by air.

Other major variables in dust generation are moisture content, vehicle size, and the amount of traffic on the trail.

The ""Dryness Index"" accounts for the moisture content of the surface.  In a dry, hot environment, the generation of dust is greater than in a cool, moist environment.  Thus dust generation is directly proportional to temperature and inversely proportional to rainfall.

An array of materials is available for overcoming dust limitations (Gebhart et al, 1999).

	12. Dusty: Dustiness is a concern for human health as well as aesthetic reasons.  Dust generation from roads is a significant source of inhalable particulate matter.  Two dust particle sizes are recognized: PM10 and PM2.5, relating to particles of aerodynamic diameters of 10 and 2.5 microns, respectively.  The capacity of soils to produce dust particles has been found by Carvacho et al (2004) to be directly related to the clay or silt content of the soil.  Thus, the PM10 or PM2.5 generation capacity of a soil is inversely proportional to its sand content.  Gypsum is also related to dustiness because the soft crystals are relatively easily crushed to silt and clay size particles which can then be picked up by air.

Other major variables in dust generation are moisture content, vehicle size, and the amount of traffic on the road.

The ""Dryness Index"" accounts for the moisture content of the surface.  In a dry, hot environment, the generation of dust is greater than in a cool, moist environment.  Thus dust generation is directly proportional to temperature and inversely proportional to rainfall.

An array of materials is available for overcoming dust limitations (Gebhart et al, 1999).

CO643,URB/REC - Picnic Areas,limitation,"Summary:

Soil interpretations for recreational development are to be used to guide the user in identifying and evaluating the suitability of the soil for specific recreational purposes.  The soil survey interpretation rating guides are applicable to both heavily and sparsely populated areas, depending upon the objectives of the user.  The ratings are for soils in their present condition and do not consider present land use.  These ratings do not consider location and accessibility of the area, size and shape of the area, scenic quality, the ability of the soil to support vegetation, access to water or potential sites for water impoundment.  Nor do the ratings consider access to public sewers or the capacity of the soil to support localized sanitary facilities such as septic tank adsorption fields or sanitary landfills.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Picnic Areas"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Picnic Areas"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Picnic areas are natural or landscaped tracts used primarily for preparing meals and eating outdoors.  These areas are subject to heavy foot traffic.  Most vehicular traffic is confined to access roads and parking lots.  Soils ratings are based on properties that influence the development costs of shaping the site, trafficability, and the growth of vegetation after development.

Many soil survey areas in sparsely populated parts of the country have soil surveys of lower intensity.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.

Scope: National

Soil properties and qualities considered in rating the degree of limitation are those that influence the ease of developing picnic areas and the performance of the picnic areas after development.  Soil properties that influence trafficability and promote the growth of vegetation after heavy use are important.

Slope and stoniness are the main concerns in developing picnic areas.  For good trafficability, the surface of picnic areas should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under heavy foot traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence trafficability are texture of the surface layer, wetness, permeability, and large stones.  The limitations of slow permeability and clayey surface texture are not as severe in dry regions of the country; however, silty soils may be more of a problem because they are dusty.  Soil properties that influence the growth of plants are depth to bedrock, permeability, and the presence of toxic materials.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Playgrounds"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Playgrounds are areas used intensively for games, such as baseball and football, and similar activities.  Playgrounds require a nearly level soil that is free of stones and that can withstand heavy foot traffic and still maintain adequate vegetation.  Soils ratings are based on properties that influence the cost of shaping, trafficability, and the growth of vegetation.

Many soil survey areas in sparsely populated parts of the country have soil surveys of lower intensity.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.

Scope: National

Soil properties and qualities considered in rating the degree of limitation are those that influence the ease of developing playgrounds and the performance of playgrounds after development.  Slope and stoniness are the main concerns in developing playgrounds.  For good trafficability, the surface of playgrounds should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under heavy foot traffic, and not be dusty when dry.

Soil properties that influence trafficability are texture of the surface layer, wetness, permeability, and large stones.  The limitations of slow permeability and clayey surface texture are not as severe in dry regions of the country; however, silty soils may be more of a problem because they are dusty.  Soil properties that influence the growth of plants are depth to bedrock, permeability, and the presence of toxic materials.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

	1.  Content of organic matter: Soil in Unified class pt is high in organic materials, has low strength, and is hard to reclaim.  Soil feature considered is the rv or first Unified class of the surface layer if the layer is greater then 25cm thick.

	17. Dusty: Dustiness is a concern for human health as well as aesthetic reasons.  Dust generation from roads is a significant source of inhalable particulate matter.  Two dust particle sizes are recognized: PM10 and PM2.5, relating to particles of aerodynamic diameters of 10 and 2.5 microns, respectively.  The capacity of soils to produce dust particles has been found by Carvacho et al (2004) to be directly related to the clay or silt content of the soil.  Thus, the PM10 or PM2.5 generation capacity of a soil is inversely proportional to its sand content.  Gypsum is also related to dustiness because the soft crystals are relatively easily crushed to silt and clay size particles which can then be picked up by air.

Other major variables in dust generation are moisture content, vehicle size, and the amount of traffic on the area.

The ""Dryness Index"" accounts for the moisture content of the surface.  In a dry, hot environment, the generation of dust is greater than in a cool, moist environment.  Thus dust generation is directly proportional to temperature and inversely proportional to rainfall.

An array of materials is available for overcoming dust limitations (Gebhart et al, 1999).

CO643,"WMS - Embankments, Dikes, and Levees",limitation,"Summary:

Soil interpretations for various water management practices are developed for use in evaluating the potential of the soil for various water management practices.  These practices may involve the movement of water to or from a site, holding water on a site, or securing a water source.  The soil survey interpretation rating guides are applicable to both heavily and sparsely populated areas, depending upon the objectives of the user.  The ratings are for soils in their present condition and do not consider present land use.  Soil limitation ratings and associated restrictive features are given for ponds and reservoir areas; embankments, dikes, and levees; and excavated ponds.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Embankments, Dikes, and Levees"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Embankments, Dikes, and Levees"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Embankments, dikes, and levees are raised structures of soil material that are constructed to impound water or protect land against overflow.  They generally are less than 20 feet high, are constructed of ""homogeneous"" soil material (without a core zone), and are compacted to medium density.  Embankments that have zoned construction (core and shell) are not considered.

Soil properties influence development of embankments, dikes, and levees including site selection, structure design, construction, performance, and after construction maintenance.  The soil interpretations for embankments, dikes, and levees are used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for the practice.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Scope: National

Ratings are made for the soil that may be source of material for embankment fills.  The rating is given for the whole soil, from the surface to a depth of about 5 feet, based on the assumption that soil horizons will be mixed in loading, dumping, and spreading.  The ratings do not indicate the suitability of the undisturbed soil for supporting the embankment.  Soil properties to a depth greater than the embankment height have an effect on the performance and safety of the embankment.  Generally, deeper onsite geologic investigations must be made to determine these important properties.


Ratings are based on soil properties and qualities to act as a natural barrier against seepage into deeper layers, without regard to cutoff trenches or other features that may be installed under the pond embankment.  Excessive slope in the direction perpendicular to the axis of the pond embankment seriously reduces the storage capacity of the reservoir area.  Suitable sites may be difficult to find on slopes steeper than about 10 percent.

Embankments, dikes, and levees require soil material that is resistant to seepage, piping, and erosion and that has favorable compaction characteristics.  Organic soils are not suitable because of high compression, low strength, and unpredictable permeability.  When compacting with tamping rollers (sheepsfoot rollers) or pneumatic rollers, stones over 6 inches in size must be removed; therefore, stony soils are limited for this use.  If a water table is present, the depth of usable material and the trafficability are affected.

The content of sodium and salts affects the capability for plant growth on embankment surfaces.  These properties may also indicate dispersive soils that are highly erosive and susceptible to piping.  Soils that contain gypsum may have piping and uneven settling.

Low-density silts and clays in the supporting foundation generally have excessive settlement and low strength.  Loose soils in arid regions undergo much settlement very rapidly upon becoming saturated as water is impounded.  These soils generally do not provide adequate support for embankments.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

	1.  Hard to pack: Fine textured soils high in sodium and gypsum content with high plasticity and liquid limits are difficult to compact.  These hard to pact soil are limited for use in building embankments, dikes, and levees.   The interpretive model uses the maximum sodium or gypsum rating index and adds the low compaction index.  This sum is compared to the liquid limit index and the lowest index is applied to the parent rule.

11. Dust: Dustiness is a concern for human health as well as aesthetic reasons.  Dust generation from roads is a significant source of inhalable particulate matter.  Two dust particle sizes are recognized: PM10 and PM2.5, relating to particles of aerodynamic diameters of 10 and 2.5 microns, respectively.  The capacity of soils to produce dust particles has been found by Carvacho et al (2004) to be directly related to the clay or silt content of the soil.  Thus, the PM10 or PM2.5 generation capacity of a soil is inversely proportional to its sand content.  Gypsum is also related to dustiness because the soft crystals are relatively easily crushed to silt and clay size particles which can then be picked up by air.

Other major variables in dust generation are moisture content, vehicle size, and the amount of working of the soil.

The ""Dryness Index"" accounts for the moisture content of the surface.  In a dry, hot environment, the generation of dust is greater than in a cool, moist environment.  Thus dust generation is directly proportional to temperature and inversely proportional to rainfall.

An array of materials is available for overcoming dust limitations (Gebhart et al, 1999).

CO643,WMS - Excavated Ponds (Aquifer-fed),limitation,"Summary:

Soil interpretations for various water management practices are developed for use in evaluating the potential of the soil for various water management practices.  These practices may involve the movement of water to or from a site, holding water on a site, or securing a water source.  The soil survey interpretation rating guides are applicable to both heavily and sparsely populated areas, depending upon the objectives of the user.  The ratings are for soils in their present condition and do not consider present land use.  Soil limitation ratings and associated restrictive features are given for ponds and reservoir areas; embankments, dikes, and levees; and excavated ponds.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for "" Excavated Ponds (Aquifer-fed)"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise ""Excavated Ponds (Aquifer-fed)"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

An aquifer-fed excavated pond is a body of water created by excavating a pit or dugout into a ground-water aquifer.  Excluded are ponds that are fed by surface runoff and embankment ponds that impound water 3 feet or more above the original surface.

Scope: National

Soil properties and qualities that affect aquifer-fed excavated ponds are depth to a permanent water table, permeability of the aquifer, and quality of water as determined by inference from the salinity of the soil.  Large stones are also considered because of their effect on the ease of excavation.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

	1.  Cutbanks cave: Soils with high water table are suited for aquifer-fed ponds.  However, cutbanks may cave or slump during excavation of the pond reservoir and pose a safety concern when the soil texture is silt or texture group is sandy or texture modifier is sandy or gravelly.  This tendency is true for all soils but to a lesser degree and the interpretive model is designed to give a rating no less then .1 ""Somewhat limiting"".  Extreme care and caution should be used around cutbanks to protect from cave in injury or death.  Cutbanks caving can also reduce the life expectancy of the pond unless practices are applied to limit slumping once the reservoir is filled.  Soil feature considered is the rv or first USDA Texture modifier and class of each layer and the top depth of the first layer where soil moisture layer status is wet or saturated during any month.

	Property used: USDA GROUP-CLASS IN DEPTH 50-180cm (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		matches ""*S *"" or matches ""*S"" or matches ""GR*"" or matches ""* GR""

		Not limiting		=> 150cm
				
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	2.  Depth to water: Soils deep to an apparent water table are not potential sites for aquifer fed ponds.  These areas have little potential recharge capacity.  Soil feature considered is the depth to the first soil moisture layer status is wet or saturated during any month and where all subsequent layer are either wet or saturated.

	Property used: DEPTH TO HIGH WATER TABLE APPARENT MINIMUM (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:

	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	3.  Depth to hard bedrock: Shallow depth to hard bedrock limits site preparation and restricts the installation of an Aquifer-fed pond only when an apparent water table is at depth less then 150cm.  Soil features considered are depth to water table and top depth of the first restrictive layer where restrictive type is ""bedrock (lithic)"". Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table.

	Property used: DEPTH TO BEDROCK HARD (Modality - representative value)

	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		 < 150cm
		Not limiting		=> 150cm
				
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	4.  Content of large stones: Large stone impede the workability of the soil and restrict trafficability of heavy machinery and site reclamation.  Soil feature considered is the weighted average percentage of rock fragments of size greater than 75mm in the horizons above a restrictive feature or from 0 to 100 cm deep and the presence of an apparent water table.

	Property used: FRAGMENTS > 75MM WEIGHTED AVE. IN DEPTH 0-100CM (Modality - high, low, representative value)

		Not limiting		 =< 105cm
		
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	5.  Slow refill: The soil horizon with the maximum Ksat contained within an apparent water table governs the rate of water movement into an Aquifer-fed pond.  When this rate is low, refilling of the pond is slow.  Soil features considered are depth to water table and maximum permeability of the layers that occur within that depth.
	
	Property used: KSAT MAXIMUM of Apparent Water Table (Modality - high, low, representative value)
			
	Restriction limits:
		Limiting 	 	=< 1.0 micrometers/sec
		Somewhat Limiting 	 > 1.0 and < 14 micrometers/sec
		Not limiting		=> 14 micrometers/sec
		
	Null Ksat values are assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	6.  Depth to permafrost: Permafrost (permanently frozen soil layer) limits site preparation and restricts the installation of an Aquifer-fed pond only when an apparent water table is at depth less then 150cm.  Soil features considered are depth to water table and top depth of the first restrictive layer where restrictive feature depth and where kind is permafrost or USDA TEXTURE (IN-LIEU-OF) is ""cpf"" or USDA TEXTURE MODIFIER is ""pf"".

	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	7.  Salty water: Salinity soils with a high apparent water table may have reduced potential for aquifer-fed ponds.  The water source may be to salty or to high a content of undesirable minerals to be used as a source of livestock or wildlife water.  Soil feature considered is the highest value of salinity (electrical conductivity) for horizons that have any portion in the depth range 10"" to 60"" (25-150 cm) and has an apparent water table within 150cm of the surface.

Summary: Soil interpretations for ""WMS-Irrigation -General"" evaluate a soil's limitation(s) for installation and use of irrigation systems.  The ratings are for soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use. This interpretation is for non-specific irrigation methods and is intended to provide initial planning information.  If the type of irrigation system has been determined additional interpretations provide more specific information.  This interpretation does not apply if the crop planned for irrigation is rice or other crops (such as cranberries) with unique plant physiological characteristics.

The degree of limitation is expressed as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0). NOTE: Several soil criteria that result in very limited responses, do not apply when irrigating rice. This report is not applicable to basin irrigation of rice. 

The General Irrigation interpretation was developed by the Temple, Texas interpretation and irrigation engineering staff. The original interpretation rules and criteria developed by Temple, Texas interpretation staff for General irrigation has been modified to meet the need for this application in other regions of the United States.  

This application is NOT DESIGNED NOR INTENDED TO BE USED IN A REGULATORY MANNER. 

Scope: Irrigation systems are used to provide supplemental water to crops, orchards, vineyards, and vegetables in area where natural precipitation will not support desired production of crops being grown.

Description: The soil properties and qualities important in design and management are sodium adsorption ratio, depth to high water table, available water holding capacity, permeability, erosion factor, slope, calcium carbonate content, ponding, and flooding.  Soil properties and qualities that influence installation and tillage are stones, depth to bedrock or cemented pan, and depth to a high water table.  The properties and qualities that affect performance of the irrigation system are depth to bedrock or to a cemented pan, the sodium adsorption ratio, salinity, and soil reaction.  Permanently frozen soils are not suited to irrigation.
 
CRITERIA: The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

1.  Depth to hard bedrock: Shallow depth to hard bedrock limits site preparation such as shaping and leveling, reduces rooting depth and available water capacity, and restricts installation of underground irrigation practice components. Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restrictive type is ""bedrock (lithic)"". Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown
in the horizon table.

	Property used: WMS - DEPTH TO BEDROCK (PAN) (Modality - representative value)

AND
	Property used: WMS - KIND OF BEDROCK RESTRICTION (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting	      = ""bedrock (lithic)""
			Not limiting	not = ""bedrock (lithic)""
	Null restrictive feature kind is assigned to the Not limiting class.

2. Depth to soft bedrock: Shallow depth to soft bedrock limits site preparation such as shaping and leveling, reduces rooting depth and available water capacity, and restricts installation of underground irrigation practice components. Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restrictive type is ""bedrock (paralithic)"" or ""bedrock (densic)"". Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table.

	Property used: WMS - DEPTH TO BEDROCK (PAN) (Modality - representative value)

	Property used: WMS - KIND OF BEDROCK RESTRICTION (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting	      = ""bedrock (paralithic)"" or ""bedrock (densic)""
			Not limiting	not = ""bedrock (paralithic)"" or ""bedrock (densic)""
	Null restrictive feature kind is assigned to the Not limiting class.

3.  Depth to cemented pan: Shallow depth to cemented limits site preparation such as shaping and leveling, reduces rooting depth and available water capacity, and restricts installation of underground irrigation practice components.   Soil features considered are the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restriction kind = ""fragipan"", ""duripan"", ""petrocalcic"", ""ortstein"", or ""petrogypsic"".  Depth to restrictive feature shown in the component restrictions table must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table in NASIS.

		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		 = ""fragipan"" or ""duripan"" or ""petrocalcic"" or ""ortstein"" or ""petrogypsic"" 
			Not limiting		not = ""fragipan"" or ""duripan"" or ""petrocalcic"" or ""ortstein"" or ""petrogypsic"" 
	Null restrictive feature kind is assigned to the Not limiting class.
AND
	Property used: WMS - FIRST RESTRICTIVE FEATURE HARDNESS (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting	 not = ""Noncemented""
			Not limiting 	       = ""Noncemented""
	Null hardness is assigned to the limiting class.

4.  Depth to saturated zone: A shallow depth to water table will hamper installation of irrigation pipelines, appurtenances, water control structures, and earth forming that might be needed install and maintain an irrigation system.  A shallow depth to water table will also complicate the irrigation water management requirements for the site, and often increases probability of salinity problems developing.  A shallow water table will also make the soil difficult to work, restrict rooting zone, and increase risk of ground water contamination through leaching of nitrates, pesticides or other contaminants.  These areas are slow to drain and can become waterlogged and boggy during periods of heavy precipitation.  Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first layer where soil moisture layer status is wet or saturated during any month in the growing season. Soil feature used is 60 cm depth as limiting. This limitation can sometimes be overcome with installation of a properly designed drainage system.  Used greater than or equal to 90 cm as not limiting based on NEH, Part 652, Irrigation Guide, and Exhibit 2.1.


	Property used: WMS - DEPTH TO HIGH WATER TABLE MINIMUM IN GROWING SEASON (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		  < 60cm
			Somewhat limiting	=> 60 cm and <90 cm
			Not limiting		  => 90 cm
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
5.  Low Available Water Capacity:  Soils with low available water capacities have limited potential to hold irrigation water.  Irrigation system design and management is critical on soil with low AWC to insure adequate soil water for maximum plant growth and production.  Soil feature considered is the (available water capacity x layer thickness) summed through a depth of 150 cm or to a restrictive layer.  Used 0.05 cm/cm as limiting based on NEH, Part 652, Irrigation Guide, and Exhibit 2.1.

	Property used: WMS - AVAILABLE WATER CAPACITY IN DEPTH 0-150cm (PAN) (Modality - high, low, representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		=< 7.5 cm
			Somewhat limiting	  > 7.5 to < 18cm
			Not limiting		=> 18cm
	Null AWC is assigned to the Not rated class.

6.  Sodium content: Soils with high sodium adsorption ratio are prone to develop irrigation water and rainfall infiltration restriction/reductions due to soil dispersion caused by sodium in the soil and/or soil water.  Soils with elevated SARs will require monitoring of SAR in soil and irrigation water being applied, very careful irrigation water management, possible chemical treatment.  An elevated SAR may impact expected crop response to irrigation by suppressing plant growth and will require a high degree of management. Soil feature considered is the highest sodium adsorption ratio for horizons that have any portion in the depth range 0 to 150cm.

	Property used: WMS - SODIUM ADSORPTION RATIO MAXIMUM IN DEPTH 0-150cm (PAN) (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		Restriction limits:
			Very limiting		> 20
			Somewhat limiting	> 6 and < 20
			Not limiting		< 6
	Null SAR is assigned not rated.

7.  Flooding: Flooding frequency greater then rare has the potential to damage irrigation infrastructure, and impact expected crop response to irrigation by causing frequent crop damage.  Most irrigation systems involve a relatively high investment in money or labor or both. Most producers will need to be fairly certain the investment necessary to install an irrigation system will pay.  A frequently flooded area would not likely provide a very stable investment.  Frequently flooded areas are more likely to transport nutrients and agricultural chemicals, which are typically applied at a higher rate on irrigated land, off site to receiving surface waters.  Soil feature considered is maximum flooding frequency classes over 12 months.

	Property used: WMS - FLOODING FREQUENCY CLASS, Greatest ANY MONTH (PAN) (Maximum Duration) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		= Very frequent""
			Somewhat limiting	= frequent or ""occasional""
			Not limiting		= ""none"" or ""very rare"" or ""rare""
	Null frequency is assigned to the Not limiting class.

8.  Percs slowly: Soils with low hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) have slow percolation causing excess runoff and erosion during high precipitation or irrigation events.  Agri-chemical and fertilizers applied to soils with this limitation may be removed from the site by runoff and can impacting adjacent surface waters.  Timing, application rates, and application methods are management tools that can be used when applying these products to soil susceptible to slow percolation.  Soil feature considered is the horizon with the lowest Ksat that has any portion in the depth range 0 to 150 cm or to a restrictive layer if less then 150 cm.

	Property used: WMS - KSAT MINIMUM, 0-150CM OR FIRST RESTRICTION (PAN) (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		Restriction limits:
			Very limiting		=< 0.14 micrometers/second
			Somewhat limiting	  > 0.14 and < 1.40 micrometers/second
			Not limiting		=> 1.40 micrometers/second	
	Null Ksat is assigned not rated.

9. Ponding: Ponding may damage irrigation infrastructure, and will likely impact expected crop response to irrigation by causing frequent crop damage.  Most irrigation systems involve a relatively high investment in money or labor or both. Most producers will need to be fairly certain the investment necessary to install an irrigation system will pay.  A ponding area would not likely provide a very stable investment.  Soil feature considered is ponding duration any month during the growing season. Soil feature considered is ponding duration.  This limitation can sometimes be overcome with installation of a properly designed drainage system.  
	
	Property used: WMS - PONDING DURATION DURING GROWING SEASON (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		= ""long"" or ""very long""
			Somewhat limiting	= brief or ""very brief""
			Not limiting		= ""none""
	Null ponding duration is assigned to the Not limiting class.

10. Excess salt: Soils with elevated salinity levels will require EC monitoring of soil and irrigation water being applied.  Matching irrigated crop selection to expected salinity levels, proper leaching, and careful irrigation water management, will be required on soils with elevated salinity. A properly designed drainage system may be required to properly irrigate some soils with elevated salinity levels.  Irrigation runoff and associated subsurface drainage from these soils has potential to increase salinity levels in groundwater, downstream surface waters, and wetlands.  Soil feature considered is the horizon with the highest electrical conductivity 0-150 cm.

	Property used: WMS - SALINITY MAXIMUM (PAN) (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		Restriction limits:
			Somewhat limiting	=> 4 
			Not limiting		  < 4
	Null EC is assigned not rated.

11. Slope: Limitation due to slope is highly dependant on type of irrigation system. Moderate slopes may increase runoff and erosion, when used with surface irrigation methods and specific types of mobile sprinkler irrigation systems (LEPA, LESA, LPIC, and MESA).   LEPA, LESA, LPIC, and MESA are sprinklers equipped with low pressure spray nozzles that operate on drops.  The closer the nozzle spacing and lower the drop the greater potential for runoff and irrigation induced erosion on a given soil.  Actual limiting slopes for sprinkler irrigation systems using spray nozzles on drops would be  average slope >1% for LEPA, average slope > 3.0% for LESA; and for LIPC and MESA systems average slope > 3% and surface texture finer than loam, or > 5% and surface texture loam or coarser.  All other sprinkler systems would have limitations at >= 15%.  Surface irrigation systems would have a limitation at or above 3 % slope.  Soil feature considered is the component slope.

	Property used: WMS - SLOPE (PAN) (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		Restriction limits:
			Very limiting 		=> 15 	
       			Somewhat limiting	   >1 and < 15			
			Not limiting 		=< 1%

15.  Content of large stones: Large stones may impede installation of pipelines and water control structures, irrigation land leveling and/or shaping, and construction of earthen canals, ditches, or ridges.

Summary: Soil interpretations for ""WMS- Micro-irrigation, (Above Ground)"" evaluate a soil's limitation(s) for irrigation systems that apply water at a slow rate near the plants or crops being irrigated. The ratings are for soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use.

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition). If a soil's property within 100 cm (40 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.

The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule. Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation. These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation. These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).

The Drip or Trickle Irrigation interpretation was developed by the Davis, California interpretation staff in cooperation with the University of California. The original interpretation rules and criteria developed by Davis, California interpretation staff for Drip or Trickle Irrigation had been modified to meet states needs for this application in other part of the United States.  

This application is NOT DESIGNED NOR INTENDED TO BE USED IN A REGULATORY MANNER. 

Drip or trickle irrigation is the controlled application of water to supplement rainfall. The soil properties and qualities that affect design, layout, construction, management, or performance of the irrigation system are evaluated and their degree of limitation determines the final rating.

Scope:  Micro-irrigation systems are irrigation systems that generally apply frequent application of small quantities of water on or below the soil surface: as drops, tiny streams or miniature spray through emitters or applicators placed along a water delivery line.   Generally, these irrigation systems are very efficient irrigation technologies in terms of both water and energy use and are suitable for used in vineyards, orchards, windbreaks, truck crops, nurseries, and on some row crops.  This interpretation report addresses micro-irrigation systems which emit or apply water at or on the soil surface.  The Micro-irrigation, Subsurface Drip Irrigation (SDI) report addresses micro-irrigation systems that apply water below the soil surface.  

Description: The soil properties and qualities important in the design and management of drip irrigation systems are depth, wetness or ponding, a need for drainage, percolation, and flooding. The soil properties and qualities that influence installation are depth, flooding and ponding. The features that affect performance of the system and plant growth are the amount of salts, lime, gypsum or sodium.

CRITERIA: The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

1.  Depth to hard bedrock: Shallow depth to hard bedrock limits site preparation, reduces rooting depth and available water capacity, and restricts installation of underground irrigation practice components. Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restrictive type is ""bedrock (lithic)"". Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table.

Property used: WMS - DEPTH TO BEDROCK (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		   < 50cm
			Somewhat limiting	=> 50cm and < 100cm
			Not limiting		=> 100cm
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.
AND
	Property used: WMS - KIND OF BEDROCK RESTRICTION (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting	= ""bedrock (lithic)""
			Not limiting	not = ""bedrock (lithic)""
	Null restrictive feature kind is assigned to the Not limiting class.

2.  Depth to soft bedrock: Shallow depth to soft bedrock limits site preparation, reduces rooting depth and available water capacity, and restricts installation of underground irrigation practice components. Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restrictive type is ""bedrock (paralithic)"" or ""bedrock (densic)"". Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table.

Property used: WMS - DEPTH TO BEDROCK (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		   < 50cm
			Somewhat limiting	= > 50cm and < 100cm
			Not limiting		=> 100cm
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.
AND
	Property used: WMS - KIND OF BEDROCK RESTRICTION (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting	 = ""bedrock (paralithic)"" or ""bedrock (densic)""
			Not limiting	 not = ""bedrock (paralithic)"" or ""bedrock (densic)""
	Null restrictive feature kind is assigned to the Not limiting class.

3.  Depth to cemented pan: A shallow depth to cemented pan could also reduce rooting depth and available water capacity, making it unlikely that anticipated crop response to microirrigation will be achieved.  Soil features considered are the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restriction _ kind = ""fragipan"", ""duripan"", ""petrocalcic"", ""ortstein"", or ""petrogypsic"".  Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table.

	Property used: WMS - DEPTH TO FIRST RESTRICTIVE FEATURE (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		  < 50cm
			Somewhat limiting	=> 50 and < 100cm
			Not limiting		=> 100cm
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.
AND
Property used: WMS - KIND OF RESTRICTION (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting	= ""fragipan"" or ""duripan"" or ""petrocalcic"" or ""ortstein"" or ""petrogypsic""
			Not limiting	not = ""fragipan"" or ""duripan"" or ""petrocalcic"" or ""ortstein"" or ""petrogypsic""
	Null restrictive feature kind is assigned to the Not limiting class.
AND
	Property used: WMS - FIRST RESTRICTIVE FEATURE HARDNESS (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting	not = ""Noncemented""
			Not limiting	= ""Noncemented""
	Null hardness is assigned to the limiting class.

4.  Depth to saturated zone: A shallow depth to water table will hamper installation of irrigation pipelines, appurtenances, and earth forming that might be needed install and maintain an irrigation system.  A shallow depth to water table will also complicate the irrigation water management requirements for the site, and often increases probability of salinity problems developing.  A shallow water table will also make the soil difficult to work, restrict rooting zone, and increase risk of ground water contamination through leaching of irrigation chemical treatment constituents, nitrates, pesticides or other contaminants.  These areas are slow to drain and can become waterlogged and boggy during periods of heavy precipitation.  Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first layer where soil moisture layer status is wet or saturated during any month in the growing season. Used 90 cm as limiting based on NEH, Part 652, Irrigation Guide, and Exhibit 2.1.  

	Property used: WMS - DEPTH TO HIGH WATER TABLE MINIMUM DURING GROWING SEASON (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		  < 60cm
			Somewhat limiting	=>60 to < 90 cm
			Not limiting		=> 90 cm
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.

5.  Sodium content: Soils with high sodium adsorption ratio are prone to develop irrigation water and rainfall infiltration restriction/reductions due to soil dispersion caused by sodium in the soil and/or soil water.  Soils with elevated SARs will require monitoring of SAR in soil and irrigation water being applied, very careful irrigation water management, possible chemical treatment.  An elevated SAR may impact expected crop response to irrigation by suppressing plant growth and will require a high degree of management. Soil feature considered is the highest sodium adsorption ratio for horizons that have any portion in the depth range 0 to 100cm.

	Property used: WMS - SODIUM ADSORPTION RATIO MAXIMUM IN DEPTH 0-100cm (PAN) (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		Restriction limits:
			Very limiting		=> 20 
			Somewhat limiting	  > 6 to < 20
			Not limiting		<= 6			
	Null SAR is assigned not rated.

6.  Flooding: Flooding: Flooding frequency greater then rare has the potential to damage irrigation infrastructure, and impact expected crop response to irrigation by causing frequent crop damage.  Most microirrigation systems involve a relatively high capitol investment. Most producers will want to be fairly certain the investment necessary to install the irrigation system will pay.  A frequently flooded area would not likely provide a very stable investment.  Frequently flooded areas are more likely to transport nutrients, and agricultural and water treatment chemicals, which are typically applied through or in conjunction with this type of irrigation system.   Soil feature considered is maximum flooding frequency classes over 12 months.

	Property used: WMS - FLOODING FREQUENCY CLASS, Greatest, ANY MONTH (PAN) (Maximum Duration) (Modality - representative value)
	Restrictive limits:
		Very limiting		= Very frequent""
		Somewhat limiting	= ""occasional or "" frequent""
		Not limiting		= ""none"" or ""very rare"" or ""rare""
	Null frequency is assigned to the Not limiting class.

7.  Ponding: Ponding restricts or effects tillage, rooting depth, and plant growth.    Ponding may damage irrigation infrastructure, and will likely impact expected crop response to irrigation by causing frequent crop damage.  Most irrigation systems involve a relatively high investment in money or labor or both. Most producers will need to be fairly certain the investment necessary to install an irrigation system will pay.  A ponding area would not likely provide a very stable investment.  Soil feature considered is ponding duration any month during the growing season. 

	Property used: WMS - PONDING DURATION GROWING SEASON (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting 		= ""long"" or ""very long""
			Somewhat limiting 	= very brief or brief
			Not limiting 		= ""none""
	Null ponding duration is assigned to the Not limiting class.

8.  Excess salt: Excess salts in soil can result in corrosion of irrigation infrastructure, significant increases in irrigation system operation and maintenance requirements, and negatively impact crop response to irrigation by restricting plant growth.  Soils with elevated salinity levels will require EC monitoring of soil and irrigation water being applied.  Matching irrigated crop selection to expected salinity levels, proper leaching, and careful irrigation water management, will be required on soils with elevated salinity. A properly designed drainage system may be required to properly irrigate some soils with elevated salinity levels.  Irrigation runoff and associated subsurface drainage from these soils has potential to increase salinity levels in groundwater, downstream surface waters, and wetlands.  Soil feature considered is the horizon with the highest electrical conductivity 0-100 cm.

	Property used: WMS - SALINITY MAXIMUM (PAN) (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		Restriction limits:
			Somewhat limiting 	=> 4 
			Not limiting 		  < 4
	Null EC is assigned not rated.

9.  Low Available Water Capacity:  Soils with low available water capacities have limited potential to hold irrigation water.  Irrigation management is critical on soil with low AWC to insure adequate soil water for maximum plant growth and production.  Soil feature considered is the (available water capacity * the layer thickness) summed through a depth of 100cm or to a restrictive layer.  Used 5 cm as limiting based on NEH, Part 652, Irrigation Guide, and Exhibit 2.1.

	Property used: WMS - AVAILABLE WATER CAPACITY IN DEPTH 0-100cm (PAN) (Modality - high, low, representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		=< 5 cm
			Somewhat limiting	  > 5 to < 12 cm
			Not limiting		=> 12 cm
	Null AWC is assigned to the Not rated class. 

10.  Soil Reaction:  (too acid or too alkaline) Low or High soil pH can result in corrosion of irrigation infrastructure, significantly increase in irrigation system operation and maintenance requirements, and impact expected crop response to irrigation by restricting plant growth.  Soil feature considered is the (pH) from 0 to 100cm.
	
	Property used: WMS - SOIL REACTION 1-1 WATER; MINIMUM, 0 TO 100CM (PAN) AND SOIL REACTION 1-1 WATER; MAXIMUM, 0 TO 100CM (PAN) (Modality - high, low, representative value)
	
			Restriction limits:  Too acid
			Very limiting		=< 3.5
			Somewhat limiting 	  > 3.5 and <5.0
			Not limiting		=> 5.0
	Null pH values are assigned to the Not rated class.

		Restriction limits:  Too alkaline
			Somewhat limiting 	  > 9.0 
			Not limiting		=< 9.0
	Null pH values are assigned to the Not rated class.


11.  Calcium Carbonate: Soils with free carbonates below the surface layer may reduce irrigation efficiency and effectiveness by increasing irrigation intake rate from what would have been estimated based on texture alone. Calcium Carbonate may restrict intake if compacted or equipment blockages from precipitation of calcium.  Free carbonates can also restrict available root zone of irrigated crops.   Soil feature considered is the maximum CaCO3 equivalent (pct in thickest layer) between 25 and 100cm (10 to 40 inches) or a restrictive layer.

	Property used: WMS - CaCO3 MAXIMUM 25-100CM OR FIRST RESTRICTION (PAN) (Modality - high, low, and representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Somewhat limiting 	=> 50%
			Not limiting 		  < 50%
	Null CaCO3 is assigned to the Not limiting class.

12.  Seepage: Rapid permeability that allows irrigation water to percolate out of the root zone is undesirable and increase irrigation management expenses.  Permeability that maintains irrigation water within the root zone during the consumptive use period is desirable to maintain the growth and vigor of the irrigated crop. 

	Property used: WMS - KSAT MAXIMUM, 0-100CM OR FIRST RESTRICTION (PAN) (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		Restriction limits:
			Very limiting		  > 44.0 um/sec
			Somewhat limiting	  > 21.0 to < 44.0 um/sec 
			Not limiting		<= 21.0 um/sec
	Null Ksat is assigned not rated.

13.  Content of large stones (a): Large stone impede installation of irrigation system pipeline mains, laterals, and appurtenances.  Large stones may make O&M on buried irrigation infrastructure more difficult and may impact expected crop response to irrigation by effecting tillage, planting, and harvesting and plant growth through reduced soil available water content.  Soil feature considered is the weighted average percentage of rock fragments of size greater than 75mm in the surface layer.

	Property used: WMS - FRAGMENTS > 75MM SURFACE LAYER (PAN) (Modality - high, low, representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		  > 35 %
			Somewhat limiting 	  > 25 % to <= 35 %
			Not limiting 		=< 25 %
	Null fragment data are assigned Not rated.

14.  Content of large stones (b): Excessive stones (rock fragments, > 10 inch in diameter) on the soil surface layer may impede installation of irrigation pipelines and appurtenances to deliver water to microirrigation (above ground) systems.   Above ground installations of main pipelines and laterals can often be used to overcome this limitation.  Above ground installations will sometimes have more varmint damage issues than below ground system delivery pipelines.  Soil feature considered is percent rock fragments > 10 inches in size on the surface soil layer.

	Property used: WMS - FRAGMENTS >=250MM ON THE SURFACE (PAN) (Modality - high, low, and representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Somewhat limiting	 => 5%
			Not limiting		< 5 %
	Null > 10 inch rock fragment data are assigned to the Not limiting class.

15.  Subsidence - The presence of gypsum or soluble salts in the soil, parent material, or bedrock may lead to the formation of subsidence features if the amount of irrigation water applied grossly exceeds evapotranspiration.  In humid climates, excessive irrigation on soils occuring over limestone bedrock can also experience sinkhole formation.  Soil features considered are the gypsum content of the soil and bedrock as well as the presence of limestone bedrock.


	Property used: ""LIMESTONE RESIDUUM TEST""  (Modality - and representative value)
	
	
		 Restrictive Limits:
		    Limiting		If the bedrock is limestone, the site is limited by the bedrock type.

Summary: Soil interpretations for ""WMS - Micro-irrigation, Subsurface Drip"" evaluate a soil's limitation(s) for irrigation systems that apply water at slow rates to the soil-rooting zone and installed beneath the soil surface.  The ratings are for soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use.

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's property within 100 cm (40 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).

The soil properties and qualities important in the design and management of drip irrigation systems are soil depth, available water capacity, wetness, or ponding, a need for drainage, percolation rate, pH, erosion potential, and flooding.  The soil properties and qualities that influence installation are soil depth, stoniness, flooding, and ponding.  The features that affect performance of the system and plant growth are available water capacity, shrink-swell, salts, lime, pH and sodium.

CRITERIA: The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

1.  Calcium Carbonate: Soils with free carbonates below the surface layer may reduce irrigation efficiency and effectiveness by increasing irrigation intake rate from what would have been estimated based on texture alone. Calcium Carbonate may restrict intake if compacted or equipment blockages from precipitation of calcium.  Free carbonates can also restrict available root zone of irrigated crops.   Soil feature considered is the maximum CaCO3 equivalent (pct in thickest layer) between 25 and 100cm (10 to 40 inches) or a restrictive layer.

	Property used: WMS - CaCO3 MAXIMUM 25-100CM OR FIRST RESTRICTION (PAN) (Modality - high, low, and representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Somewhat limiting	 => 50%
			Not limiting		   < 50%
	Null CaCO3 is assigned to the Not limiting class.

2.  Depth to hard bedrock: Shallow depth to hard bedrock can impede installation of irrigation system pipelines, appurtenances, and subsurface drip irrigation laterals.   A shallow depth to hard bedrock reduce available rooting depth, and available water capacity making it unlikely that anticipated crop response to microirrigation will be achieved.  Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restrictive type is ""bedrock (lithic)"". Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table. 

Shallow depth to bedrock also limits the soil's adsorptive capacity and the thickness of the biologically active zone through with waste materials can percolate.  Shallow soils may pose environmental and health risks when agricultural and municipal waste materials are applied. 

	Property used: WMS - DEPTH TO BEDROCK (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		  < 50 cm
			Somewhat limiting	  > 50 cm and <100 cm
			Not limiting		=> 100 cm
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.
AND
	Property used: WMS - KIND OF BEDROCK RESTRICTION (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		 = ""bedrock (lithic)""
			Not limiting not	 = ""bedrock (lithic)""
	Null restrictive feature kind is assigned to the Not limiting class.

3.  Depth to soft bedrock: Shallow depth to soft bedrock can impede installation of irrigation system pipelines, appurtenances, and subsurface drip irrigation laterals.   A shallow depth to soft bedrock reduce available rooting depth, and available water capacity making it unlikely that anticipated crop response to microirrigation will be achieved.    Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restrictive type is ""bedrock (paralithic)"" or ""bedrock (densic)"". Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the
restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table.

Property used: WMS - DEPTH TO BEDROCK (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		 =< 50cm
			Somewhat limiting	   > 50cm and < 100cm

AND
	Property used: WMS - KIND OF BEDROCK RESTRICTION (PAN) (Modality - representative value)

			Not limiting 	not = ""bedrock (paralithic)"" or ""bedrock (densic)""
	Null restrictive feature kind is assigned to the Not limiting class.

4.  Depth to cemented pan: Shallow depth to cemented pan can impede installation of subsurface drip irrigation laterals, and could result in irrigation laterals being placed below the pan making uniform soil moisture distribution problematic.  A shallow depth to cemented pan could also reduce rooting depth and available water capacity, making it unlikely that anticipated crop response to microirrigation will be achieved.  Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table. 

	Property used: WMS - DEPTH TO FIRST RESTRICTIVE FEATURE (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		=< 50cm
			Somewhat limiting	  > 50 and < 100cm
			Not limiting		=> 100cm

AND
	Property used: WMS - KIND OF RESTRICTION (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting	  = ""fragipan"" or ""duripan"" or ""petrocalcic"" or ""ortstein"" or ""petrogypsic"" 
			Not limiting	  not = ""fragipan"" or ""duripan"" or ""petrocalcic"" or ""ortstein"" or petrogypsic"" 
	Null restrictive feature kind is assigned to the Not limiting class.
AND
	Property used: WMS - FIRST RESTRICTIVE FEATURE HARDNESS (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		not = ""Noncemented""
			Not limiting		      = ""Noncemented""
	Null hardness is assigned to the limiting class.

5.  Depth to saturated zone: A shallow depth to water table will hamper installation of irrigation pipelines, SDI lateral tubing, appurtenances, and earth forming that might be needed install and maintain an irrigation system.  A shallow depth to water table will also complicate the irrigation water management requirements for the site, and often increases probability of salinity problems developing.  A shallow water table will also make the soil difficult to work, restrict rooting zone, and increase risk of ground water contamination through leaching of irrigation chemical treatment constituents, nitrates, pesticides or other contaminants.  These areas are slow to drain and can become waterlogged and boggy during periods of heavy precipitation.  Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first layer where soil moisture layer status is wet or saturated during any month in the growing season. Used 90 cm as limiting based on NEH, Part 652, Irrigation Guide, and Exhibit 2.1. 

	Property used: WMS - DEPTH TO HIGH WATER TABLE MINIMUM DURING GROWING SEASON (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		=< 60cm
			Somewhat limiting	  > 60 to < 90cm
			Not limiting		=> 90cm
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.

6.  Sodium content: Soils with high sodium adsorption ratio are prone to develop irrigation water and rainfall infiltration restriction/reductions due to soil dispersion caused by sodium in the soil and/or soil water.  Soils with elevated SARs will require monitoring of SAR in soil and irrigation water being applied, very careful irrigation water management, possible chemical treatment.  An elevated SAR may impact expected crop response to irrigation by suppressing plant growth and will require a high degree of management.  Soil feature considered is the highest sodium adsorption ratio for horizons that have any portion in the depth range 0 to 100cm.

	Property used: WMS - SODIUM ADSORPTION RATIO MAXIMUM IN DEPTH 0-100cm (PAN) (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		Restriction limits:
			Very limiting		=> 20
			Somewhat limiting	  > 6 to < 20
			Not limiting		<= 6			
	Null SAR is assigned not rated.

7.  Flooding: Flooding: Flooding frequency greater then rare has the potential to damage irrigation infrastructure, and impact expected crop response to irrigation by causing frequent crop damage.  Most microirrigation (Subsurface Drip) systems involve a relatively high capitol investment. Most producers will want to be fairly certain the investment necessary to install this type of  irrigation system will pay.  A frequently flooded area would not likely provide a very stable investment.  Frequently flooded areas are more likely to transport nutrients, and agricultural and water treatment chemicals, which are typically applied through or in conjunction with this type of irrigation system.    Soil feature considered is maximum flooding frequency classes over 12 months.

	Property used: WMS - FLOODING FREQUENCY CLASS, Greatest (PAN) (Maximum Duration) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		= Very frequent""
			Somewhat limiting	= ""occasional"" or frequent
			Not limiting		= ""none"" or ""very rare"" or ""rare""
	Null frequency is assigned to the Not limiting class.

8.  Content of large stones (a): Large stone impede installation of irrigation system mains, subsurface drip laterals, and appurtenances.  Large stones have the potential to damage SDI tubing over time when tubing is installed in contact with stones.  Large stones may make operation and management on buried microirrigation tubing more difficult and may impact expected crop response to irrigation by effecting tillage, planting, and harvesting and plant growth through reduced soil available water content.    Soil feature considered is the weighted average percentage of rock fragments of size greater than 75mm in the horizons above a restrictive feature or from 0 to 100 cm deep.

	Property used: WMS - FRAGMENTS > 75MM WEIGHTED AVE. IN DEPTH 0-100CM (PAN) (Modality - high, low, representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		=> 25%
			Somewhat limiting	  > 0% and < 25%
			Not limiting		= 0%
	Null fragment data are assigned Not rated.

9.  Content of large stones (b): Excessive stones (rock fragments, > 10 inch in diameter) on the soil surface layer may impede installation of subsurface irrigation systems and mechanized equipment operations.  Soil feature considered is percent rock fragments > 10 inches in size on the surface soil layer.

	Property used: WMS - FRAGMENTS >=250MM ON THE SURFACE (PAN) Modality - high, low, and representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		=> 5%
			Somewhat limiting	  > 0.1 to < 5%
			Not limiting		<= 0.1%
	Null > 10 inch rock fragment data are assigned to the Not limiting class.

10. Low Available Water Capacity:  Soils with low available water capacities have limited potential to hold irrigation water.  Irrigation management is critical on soil with low AWC to insure adequate soil water for maximum plant growth and production.  Soil feature considered is the (available water capacity x layer thickness) summed through a depth of 100cm or to a restrictive layer. Used 0.05 cm/cm as limiting based on NEH, Part 652, Irrigation Guide, and Exhibit 2.1.

	Property used: WMS - AVAILABLE WATER CAPACITY IN DEPTH 0-100cm (PAN) (Modality - high, low, representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		=< 5cm
			Somewhat limiting	  > 5 cm and < 12 cm
			Not limiting		=> 12 cm 
	Null AWC is assigned to the Not rated class.

11. Ponding:  Ponding restricts or effects tillage, rooting depth, and plant growth.    Ponding may damage irrigation infrastructure, and will likely impact expected crop response to irrigation by causing frequent crop damage.  Most irrigation systems involve a relatively high investment in money or labor or both. Most producers will need to be fairly certain the investment necessary to install an irrigation system will pay.  A ponding area would not likely provide a very stable investment.  Soil feature considered is ponding any month during growing season. 
	
	Property used: WMS - PONDING DURATION GROWING SEASON (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		 = long"" or ""very long""
			Somewhat limiting	 = brief or ""very brief""
			Not limiting		 = ""none""
	Null ponding duration is assigned to the Not limiting class.

12. Excess salt: Soils with high electrical conductivity may suppress plant growth and will require a high degree of management.  Soils with elevated salinity levels will require EC monitoring of soil and irrigation water being applied.  Matching irrigated crop selection to expected salinity levels, proper leaching, and careful irrigation water management, will be required on soils with elevated salinity. A properly designed drainage system may be required to properly irrigate some soils with elevated salinity levels.  Irrigation runoff and associated subsurface drainage from these soils has potential to increase salinity levels in groundwater, downstream surface waters, and wetlands.  Soil feature considered is the horizon with the highest electrical conductivity 0-100 cm.
Soil feature considered is the horizon with the highest electrical conductivity.

	Property used: WMS - SALINITY MAXIMUM (PAN) (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		Restriction limits:
			Somewhat limiting	=> 4
			Not limiting		  < 4
	Null EC is assigned not rated.

13. Seepage: Microirrigation Subsurface Irrigation Systems utilize irrigation laterals installed below the normal tillage zone to prevent damage.  Especially in drier climates rapid permeability can result in crop germination problems if applied irrigation water is unable to move up to planted seeds to insure germination.  In addition, rapid permeability that allows irrigation water to percolate out of the root zone is undesirable and increases irrigation management expenses.  Permeability that maintains irrigation water within the root zone during the consumptive use period is desirable to maintain the growth and vigor of the irrigated crop. Soil feature considered is the horizon with the highest Ksat that has any portion in the depth range 0 to 100 cm or to a restrictive layer if less then 100 cm.

	Property used: WMS - KSAT MAXIMUM, 0-100CM OR FIRST RESTRICTION (PAN) (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		Restriction limits:
			Very limiting		  > 44.0 um/sec
			Somewhat limiting	  > 21.2 to < 44.0 um/sec 
			Not limiting		<= 21.2 um/sec
	Null Ksat is assigned not rated.

14. Shrink-Swell: High shrink-swell potential limits the installation and maintenance of subsurface drip irrigation lines and emitters.  Subsurface Drip Irrigation (SDI) tubing can be damaged due to stress imposed by movement of high shrink swell clays.  Damage to buried lateral lines and resulting sediment contamination from field repairs can be significant problems on high shrink swell soils tubing is exposed by cracks allowing easy rodent access.   In some cases this limitation can be addressed by operating and managing a microirrigation (subsurface drip irrigation) system to maintain soil moisture year round at a level that will prevent soil cracking.  In drier climates and limited water supply areas this may not be an option.  Soil feature considered is the maximum linear extensibility percent

	Property used: WMS - SHRINK-SWELL, MAXIMUM 0-100CM (PAN) (Modality - high, low, representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		=> 10.5
			Somewhat limiting	  > 4.5 to < 10.5
			Not limiting		=< 4.5
	Null shrink-swell is assigned to the Not rated class.

15. Soil Reaction (too acid or alkaline): Low or high soil pH can result in corrosion of irrigation infrastructure, significantly increase in irrigation system operation and maintenance requirements, and impact expected crop response to irrigation by restricting plant growth.   Soil feature considered is the (pH) in 0-100 cm. 
	
	Property used: WMS - SOIL REACTION 1-1 WATER; MINIMUM, 0 TO 100CM (PAN) AND SOIL REACTION 1-1 WATER; MAXIMUM, 0 TO 100CM (PAN) (Modality - high, low, representative value)
	
	Restriction limits:  Too acid
			Very limiting		=< 3.5
			Somewhat limiting 	  > 3.5 and <5.0
			Not limiting		=> 5.0
	Null pH values are assigned to the Not rated class.

		Restriction limits:  Too alkaline
			Somewhat limiting 	  > 9.0 
			Not limiting		=< 9.0
	Null pH values are assigned to the Not rated class.

16. Subsidence: The presence of gypsum or soluble salts in the soil, parent material, or bedrock may lead to the formation of subsidence features if the amount of irrigation water applied grossly exceeds evapotranspiration.  In humid climates, excessive irrigation on soils occuring over limestone bedrock can also experience sinkhole formation.  Soil features considered are the gypsum content of the soil and bedrock as well as the presence of limestone bedrock.


	Property used: ""LIMESTONE RESIDUUM TEST""  (Modality - and representative value)
	
	
		 Restrictive Limits:

Summary: Soil interpretations for ""WMS-Sprinkler Irrigation, Close Spaced Outlets, Drops"" evaluate a soil's limitation(s) for installation and use of sprinkler irrigation systems equipped with close spaced outlets on drops. The ratings are for soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use. 

The degree of limitation is expressed as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition). If a soil's property within 100 cm (40 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified. 

The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule. Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation. These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation. These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and <1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).

This Irrigation Application is NOT DESIGNED OR INTENDED TO BE USED IN A REGULATORY MANNER.

Scope: Sprinkler irrigation systems (Close Spaced Outlets, Drops) are generally linear move or center pivots equipped with low pressure spray sprinkler nozzles mounted on close spaced drops that apply water close to the ground surface.  Examples of these types of systems include Low Pressure in Canopy (LPIC), Low Energy Precision Application (LEPA), Low Elevation Spray Application (LESA), and Mid Elevation Spray Application (MESA) systems.  These systems have separate slope criteria from other sprinkler systems because of their higher application rates which increase risk of runoff and irrigation induced erosion on steeper slopes.   This type of irrigation system is generally suitable for small grains, row crops, and vegetables.

Description: The soil properties and qualities important in the design and management of sprinkler irrigation systems utilizing close spaced spray nozzles on drops are depth, available water holding capacity, sodium adsorption ratio, surface coarse fragments, permeability, salinity, slope, wetness, and flooding. The features that affect performance of the system and plant growth are surface texture and rocks, salinity, sodium adsorption ratio, wetness, erosion potential, and available water holding capacity.

CRITERIA: The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

1. Too clayey: Soil with clayey surface layer has slow intake rates with associated increased potential for translocation of applied irrigation water.  The soil becomes extremely sticky when wet and causes deep rutting, which concentrates and conveys irrigation runoff.  These soils will increase operation and maintenance requirements due to stuck and slipping wheels and resulting improper sprinkler lateral alignment. These soils may also reduce plant growth and cause the irrigation system to not produce expected benefits. Soil feature considered is the clay percentage of the surface layer.

	Property used: WMS - CLAY PERCENT SURFACE LAYER (PAN) (Modality - high, low, representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting	 	=> 60%
			Somewhat limiting 	  > 40 % and < 60%
			Not limiting 		=< 40 %
	Null clay percentage is assigned to the Not rated class.

2. Depth to cemented pan: Shallow depth to cemented pan limits the soil's water holding capacity and the thickness of the root zone. Soil features considered are the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restriction kind = ""fragipan"", ""duripan"", ""petrocalcic"", ""ortstein"", or ""petrogypsic"". Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table.

3. Depth to hard bedrock: Shallow depth to hard bedrock limits site preparation such as shaping and leveling, reduces rooting depth and available water capacity, and restricts installation of underground irrigation practice components. Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restrictive type is ""bedrock (lithic)"". Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table.

Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restrictive type is ""bedrock (paralithic)"" or ""bedrock (densic)"". Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table.

Property used: WMS - DEPTH TO BEDROCK (PAN) (Modality - representative value)

	Null restrictive feature kind is assigned to the Not limiting class.

5. Depth to saturated zone: Soils with shallow depth to a water table A shallow depth to water table will hamper installation of irrigation pipelines, appurtenances, and earth forming that might be necessary to install and maintain an irrigation system.  A shallow depth to water table will also complicate the irrigation water management requirements for the site, and often increases probability of salinity problems developing.  A shallow water table will also make the soil difficult to work, restrict rooting zone, increase risk of ground water contamination through leaching of nitrates, pesticides or other contaminants.  Soil feature considered is, for any month, the top depth where soil moisture status is wet or saturated any month in the growing season. Used greater than or equal to 90 cm as not limiting based on NEH, Part 652, Irrigation Guide, and Exhibit 2.1.

	Property used: WMS - DEPTH TO HIGH WATER TABLE MINIMUM IN GROWING SEASON (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting 		=< 60cm
			Somewhat limiting	  > 60 to < 90 cm
			Not limiting 		= > 90 cm
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.

6.  Low Available Water Capacity:  Soils with low available water capacities have limited potential to hold irrigation water.  Irrigation management is critical on soil with low AWC to insure adequate soil water for maximum plant growth and production.  Soil feature considered is the (available water capacity x layer thickness) summed through a depth of 100cm or to a restrictive layer.  Used 0.05 cm/cm as limiting based on NEH, Part 652, Irrigation Guide, and Exhibit 2.1.

	Property used: WMS - AVAILABLE WATER CAPACITY IN DEPTH 0-100cm (PAN) (Modality - high, low, representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		=< 5 cm
			Somewhat limiting	  > 5 to < 12 cm
			Not limiting		=> 12 cm
	Null AWC is assigned to the Not rated class. 

7. Sodium content: Soils with high sodium adsorption ratio are prone to develop irrigation water and rainfall infiltration restriction/reductions due to soil dispersion caused by sodium in the soil and/or soil water.  Soils with elevated SARs will require monitoring of SAR in soil and irrigation water being applied, very careful irrigation water management, possible chemical treatment.  An elevated SAR may impact expected crop response to irrigation by suppressing plant growth and will require a high degree of management. Soil feature considered is the highest sodium adsorption ratio for horizons that have any portion in the depth range 0 to 100 cm.

	Property used: WMS - SODIUM ADSORPTION RATIO MAXIMUM IN DEPTH 0-100cm (PAN) (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		Restriction limits:
			Very limiting 		=> 20
			Somewhat limiting	   > 6 to < 20
			Not limiting 		 <= 6
	Null SAR is assigned not rated.

8.  Flooding: Flooding frequency greater then rare has the potential to damage irrigation infrastructure, and impact expected crop response to irrigation by causing frequent crop damage.  Most irrigation systems involve a relatively high investment in money or labor or both. Most producers will need to be fairly certain the investment necessary to install an irrigation system will pay.  A frequently flooded area would not likely provide a very stable investment.  Frequently flooded areas are more likely to transport nutrients and agricultural chemicals, which are typically applied at a higher rate on irrigated land off site to receiving surface waters. Soil feature considered is maximum flooding frequency classes over 12 months.

	Property used: WMS - FLOODING FREQUENCY CLASS, Greatest, ANY MONTH (PAN) (Maximum Duration) (Modality - representative value)
	Restrictive limits:
		Very limiting		= Very frequent""
		Somewhat limiting	= ""occasional"" or "" frequent""
		Not limiting		= ""none"" or ""very rare"" or ""rare""
	Null frequency is assigned to the Not limiting class.

9. Content of large stones: Large stones may impede installation of underground supply pipelines and to supply sprinkler systems trafficability and tillage, planting and harvesting of crops.  Large stones may also impact operation and management  requirements of the irrigation system by damaging mobile system components and complicating pipeline and irrigation system repairs, and will impact expected crop response to irrigation by effecting tillage, planting, harvesting and plant growth through reduced soil AWC.  Soil feature considered is the weighted average percentage of rock fragments of size greater than 75mm in horizons above a restrictive feature or from 0 to 100 cm deep. The degree of limitation is reduced by subtraction. Given this constraint; a somewhat limiting 0.5 is the highest degree of limitation given.

10. Ponding: Ponding restricts or effects tillage, rooting depth, and plant growth. Soil feature considered is ponding duration.  Ponding may damage irrigation infrastructure, and will likely impact expected crop response to irrigation by causing frequent crop damage.  Most sprinkler irrigation systems involve a relatively high capital investment.   Most producers will need to be fairly certain the investment necessary to install a Sprinkler close spaced outlets on drops  will pay.  Significant ponding areas would not likely provide a very stable investment.  Soil feature considered is ponding duration any month during the growing season. Soil feature considered is ponding duration.  This limitation can sometimes be overcome with installation of a properly designed drainage system.  

Property used: WMS - PONDING DURATION DURING GROWING SEASON (PAN) (Modality - representative value)

11. Excess salt: Soils with high electrical conductivity will tend to increase corrosion of metal irrigation system components.  Soils with elevated salinity levels will require EC monitoring of soil and irrigation water being applied.  Matching irrigated crop selection to expected salinity levels, proper leaching, and careful irrigation water management, will be required on soils with elevated salinity.  Leaching applications can be very difficult to apply without producing runoff due to high application rates associated with this type of sprinkler irrigation system. A properly designed drainage system may be required to properly irrigate some soils with elevated salinity levels.  Irrigation runoff and potential subsurface drainage during leaching applications from these soils has potential to increase salinity levels in groundwater, downstream surface waters, and wetlands.  Soil feature considered is the horizon with the highest electrical conductivity 0-100 cm.

12. Slope: Slopes may increase runoff and erosion, when used with specific sprinklers equipped with close spaced low pressure spray nozzles that are discharge types of sprinkler systems (LEPA, LESA, LPIC, and MESA. LEPA, LESA, LPIC, and MESA are sprinklers equipped with low pressure spray nozzles that operate on drops.  The closer the nozzle spacing and lower the drop the greater potential for runoff and irrigation induced erosion on a given soil.  Actual limiting slopes for sprinkler irrigation systems using spray nozzles on drops would be  average slope >1% for LEPA, average slope > 3.0% for LESA; and for LIPC and MESA systems average slope > 3% and surface texture finer than loam, or > 5% and surface texture loam or coarser.  Soil feature considered is the component slope.

13. Percs slowly: Soils with low surface hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) and smectitic mineralogy have slow percolation causing excess runoff and erosion during high precipitation or irrigation events. Agri-chemical and fertilizers applied to soil's with this limitation may be removed from the site by runoff and can impacting adjacent surface waters. Timing, application rates, and application methods are management tools that can be used when applying these products to soil susceptible to slow percolation. Soil feature considered is the horizon with the lowest Ksat that has any portion in the depth range 0 to 100cm or to a restrictive layer if less then 100cm and the surface horizon's Ksat.

			Not limiting		=< 9.0
	Null pH values are assigned to the Not rated class.

	Null pH values are assigned to the Not rated class.

15. Calcium Carbonate: Soils with free carbonates below the surface layer may reduce irrigation efficiency and effectiveness by increasing irrigation intake rate from what would have been estimated based on texture alone. Calcium Carbonate may restrict intake if compacted or blockages of equipment from precipitation of calcium.  Free carbonates can also restrict available root zone of irrigated crops.

17.  Subsidence: The presence of gypsum or soluble salts in the soil, parent material, or bedrock may lead to the formation of subsidence features if the amount of irrigation water applied grossly exceeds evapotranspiration.  In humid climates, excessive irrigation on soils occuring over limestone bedrock can also experience sinkhole formation.  Soil features considered are the gypsum content of the soil and bedrock as well as the presence of limestone bedrock.

Summary: Soil interpretations for ""WMS-Sprinkler Irrigation"" evaluate a soil's limitation(s) for installation and use of sprinkler irrigation systems excluding those equipped with close spaced outlets on drops which are covered in a different interpretation report.  The ratings are for soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use. 

The degree of limitation is expressed as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition). If a soil's property within 100 cm (40 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified. 

The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule. Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation. These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation. These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and <1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).

This Irrigation Application is NOT DESIGNED OR INTENDED TO BE USED IN A REGULATORY MANNER.

Scope: Sprinkler irrigation systems apply irrigation water to a field through a series of pipes and nozzles and can be either solid set or mobile.  Generally, this type of irrigation system is suitable for small grains, row crops, vegetables, and orchards. 

Description: The soil properties and qualities important in the design and management of sprinkler irrigation systems are depth, available water holding capacity, sodium adsorption ratio, surface coarse fragments, permeability, salinity, slope, wetness, and flooding. The features that affect performance of the system and plant growth are surface texture and rocks, salinity, sodium adsorption ratio, wetness, erosion potential, and available water holding capacity.

CRITERIA: The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

1. Too clayey: Soil with clayey surface layer has slow intake rates with associated increased potential for translocation of applied irrigation water.  The soil becomes extremely sticky when wet and causes deep rutting, which concentrates and conveys irrigation runoff.  These soils can increase operation and maintenance requirements due to stuck and slipping wheels and resulting improper sprinkler lateral alignment on mobile systems. These soils also reduce plant growth and prevent the sprinkler irrigation system from producing expected benefits. Soil feature considered is the clay percentage of the surface layer.

	Property used: WMS - CLAY PERCENT SURFACE LAYER (PAN) (Modality - high, low, representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		=> 60%
			Somewhat limiting 	  > 40 % and <= 60%
Not limiting 		  < 40 %
	Null clay percentage is assigned to the Not rated class.

2. Depth to cemented pan: Shallow depth to cemented pan limits the soil's water holding capacity and the thickness of the root zone. Soil features considered are the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restriction kind = ""fragipan"", ""duripan"", ""petrocalcic"", ""ortstein"", or ""petrogypsic"". Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table.

	Property used: WMS - DEPTH TO FIRST RESTRICTIVE FEATURE (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		=< 50 cm
			Somewhat limiting	=> 50 cm and < 100 cm
			Not limiting 		=> 100cm
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.
AND
	Property used: WMS - KIND OF FIRST RESTRICTION (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting 	= ""fragipan"" or ""duripan"" or ""petrocalcic"" or ""ortstein"" or ""petrogypsic""
			Not limiting 	not =""fragipan"" or ""duripan"" or ""petrocalcic"" or ""ortstein"" or ""petrogypsic""
	Null restrictive feature kind is assigned to the Not limiting class.
AND
	Property used: WMS - RESTRICTIVE FEATURE HARDNESS (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting	 not =""Noncemented""
			Not limiting	 = ""Noncemented""
	Null hardness is assigned to the limiting class.

3. Depth to hard bedrock: Shallow depth to hard bedrock limits site preparation such as shaping and leveling, reduces rooting depth and available water capacity, and restricts installation of underground irrigation practice components. Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restrictive type is ""bedrock (lithic)"". Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table. 

Property used: WMS - DEPTH TO BEDROCK (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		=< 50 cm
			Somewhat limiting 	  > 50 cm and <100 cm
			Not limiting 		=> 100 cm
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.
AND
	Property used: WMS - KIND OF BEDROCK RESTRICTION (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting 		= ""bedrock (lithic)""
			Not limiting not 	= ""bedrock (lithic)""
	Null restrictive feature kind is assigned to the Not limiting class.

4. Depth to soft bedrock: Shallow depth to soft bedrock limits site preparation such as shaping and leveling, reduces rooting depth and available water capacity, and restricts installation of underground irrigation practice components. Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restrictive type is ""bedrock (paralithic)"" or ""bedrock (densic)"". Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table.

	Property used: WMS - DEPTH TO BEDROCK (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		=< 50cm
			Somewhat limiting	  > 50cm and < 100cm
			Not limiting 		=> 100cm
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.
AND
	Property used: WMS - KIND OF BEDROCK RESTRICTION (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting 		= ""bedrock (paralithic)"" or ""bedrock (densic)""
			Not limiting not 	= ""bedrock (paralithic)"" or ""bedrock (densic)""
	Null restrictive feature kind is assigned to the Not limiting class.

5. Depth to saturated zone: Soils with shallow depth to a water table A shallow depth to water table will hamper installation of irrigation pipelines, appurtenances, and earth forming that might be necessary to install and maintain an irrigation system.  A shallow depth to water table will also complicate the irrigation water management requirements for the site, and often increases probability of salinity problems developing.  A shallow water table will also make the soil difficult to work, restrict rooting zone, and increase risk of ground water contamination through leaching of nitrates, pesticides or other contaminants.  Soil feature considered is, for any month, the top depth where soil moisture status is wet or saturated any month in the growing season. Used greater than or equal to 90 cm as not limiting based on NEH, Part 652, Irrigation Guide, and Exhibit 2.1.


	Property used: WMS - DEPTH TO HIGH WATER TABLE MINIMUM IN GROWING SEASON (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting 		< 60cm
			Somewhat limiting	  => 60 and < 90 cm
			Not limiting 		= > 90 cm
Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.

6.  Low Available Water Capacity:  Soils with low available water capacities have limited potential to hold irrigation water.  Irrigation management is critical on soil with low AWC to insure adequate soil water for maximum plant growth and production.  Soil feature considered is the (available water capacity x layer thickness) summed through a depth of 100cm or to a restrictive layer.  Used 0.05 cm/cm as limiting based on NEH, Part 652, Irrigation Guide, and Exhibit 2.1.

	Property used: WMS - AVAILABLE WATER CAPACITY IN DEPTH 0-100cm (PAN) (Modality - high, low, representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		=< 5 cm
			Somewhat limiting	  > 5 and < 12 cm
			Not limiting		=> 12 cm
	Null AWC is assigned to the Not rated class. 

7. Sodium content: Soils with high sodium adsorption ratio are prone to develop irrigation water and rainfall infiltration restriction/reductions due to soil dispersion caused by sodium in the soil and/or soil water.  Soils with elevated SARs will require monitoring of SAR in soil and irrigation water being applied, very careful irrigation water management, possible chemical treatment.  An elevated SAR may impact expected crop response to irrigation by suppressing plant growth and will require a high degree of management. Soil feature considered is the highest sodium adsorption ratio for horizons that have any portion in the depth range 0 to 100 cm.

	Property used: WMS - SODIUM ADSORPTION RATIO MAXIMUM IN DEPTH 0-100cm (PAN) (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		Restriction limits:
			Very limiting 		=> 20
			Somewhat limiting	  > 6 to < 20
			Not limiting 		<= 6
	Null SAR is assigned not rated.

8.  Flooding: Flooding frequency greater then rare has the potential to damage irrigation infrastructure, and impact expected crop response to irrigation by causing frequent crop damage.  Most irrigation systems involve a relatively high investment in money or labor or both. Most producers will need to be fairly certain the investment necessary to install an irrigation system will pay.  A frequently flooded area would not likely provide a very stable investment.  Frequently flooded areas are more likely to transport nutrients and agricultural chemicals, which are typically applied at a higher rate on irrigated land off site to receiving surface waters. Soil feature considered is maximum flooding frequency classes over 12 months.

	Property used: WMS - FLOODING FREQUENCY CLASS, Greatest, ANY MONTH (PAN) (Maximum Duration) (Modality - representative value)
	Restrictive limits:
		Very limiting		= Very frequent""
		Somewhat limiting	= ""occasional"" or "" frequent"" 
		Not limiting		= ""none"" or ""very rare"" or ""rare""
	Null frequency is assigned to the Not limiting class.

9. Content of large stones: Large stones may impede installation of underground supply pipelines and to supply sprinkler systems trafficability and tillage, planting and harvesting of crops.  Large stones may also impact operation and management requirements of the irrigation system by damaging mobile system components and complicating pipeline and irrigation system repairs, and will impact expected crop response to irrigation by effecting tillage, planting, harvesting and plant growth through reduced soil AWC.  Soil feature considered is the weighted average percentage of rock fragments of size greater than 75mm in horizons above a restrictive feature or from 0 to 100 cm deep. The degree of limitation is reduced by subtraction. Given this constraint; a somewhat limiting 0.5 is the highest degree of limitation given. 

	Property used: WMS - FRAGMENTS > 75MM WEIGHTED AVE. IN DEPTH 0-100CM (PAN) (Modality - high, low, representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting 		=> 35%
			Somewhat limiting	  > 25% and <= 35%
			Not limiting 		=< 25%
	Null fragment data are assigned Not rated.

10. Ponding: Ponding restricts or effects tillage, rooting depth, and plant growth. Soil feature considered is ponding duration.  Ponding may damage irrigation infrastructure, and will likely impact expected crop response to irrigation by causing frequent crop damage.  Most sprinkler irrigation systems involve a relatively high capital investment.   Most producers will need to be fairly certain the investment necessary to install a Sprinkler close spaced outlets on drops  will pay.  Significant ponding areas would not likely provide a very stable investment.  Soil feature considered is ponding duration any month during the growing season. Soil feature considered is ponding duration.  This limitation can sometimes be overcome with installation of a properly designed drainage system.  


	Property used: WMS - PONDING DURATION GROWING SEASON (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		 = ""long"" or ""very long""
			Somewhat limiting	 = ""very brief"" or brief
			Not limiting		 = ""none""
	Null ponding duration is assigned to the Not limiting class.

11. Excess salt: Soils with high electrical conductivity may suppress plant growth and will tend to increase corrosion of metal irrigation system components.  Soils with elevated salinity levels will require EC monitoring of soil and irrigation water being applied.  Matching irrigated crop selection to expected salinity levels, proper leaching, and careful irrigation water management, will be required on soils with elevated salinity.  Leaching applications can be very difficult to apply without producing runoff due to high application rates associated with this type of sprinkler irrigation system. A properly designed drainage system may be required to properly irrigate some soils with elevated salinity levels.  Irrigation runoff and potential subsurface drainage during leaching applications from these soils has potential to increase salinity levels in groundwater, downstream surface waters, and wetlands.  Soil feature considered is the horizon with the highest electrical conductivity 0-100 cm.

			Not limiting 		  < 4
	Null EC is assigned not rated.

12.

Soil feature considered is the component slope.
		
	Property used: WMS - SLOPE (PAN) (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		Restriction limits:
			Very limiting		=> 15%
			Somewhat limiting	   > 6 and < 15%
			Not limiting		=< 6%			
	Null Slope is assigned Not rated.


13. Percs slowly: Soils with low surface hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) and smectitic mineralogy have slow percolation causing excess runoff and erosion during high precipitation or irrigation events. Agri-chemical and fertilizers applied to soil's with this limitation may be removed from the site by runoff and can impacting adjacent surface waters. Timing, application rates, and application methods are management tools that can be used when applying these products to soil susceptible to slow percolation. Soil feature considered is the horizon with the lowest Ksat that has any portion in the depth range 0 to 100cm or to a restrictive layer if less then 100cm and the surface horizon's Ksat and soil mineralogy.

Soil feature considered is the (pH) in 0-100 cm. 
	
	Property used: WMS - SOIL REACTION 1-1 WATER; MINIMUM, 0 TO 100CM (PAN) AND SOIL REACTION 1-1 WATER; MAXIMUM, 0 TO 100CM (PAN) (Modality - high, low, representative value)

		Restrictive limits:

Summary: Soil interpretations for WMS-Surface Irrigation (Graded)"" evaluate a soil's limitation(s) for installation and use of graded flood or furrow irrigation systems. The ratings are for soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use. 

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition). If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified. The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule. Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation. These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications. 

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation. These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0). 

This Irrigation Application is NOT DESIGNED OR INTENDED TO BE USED IN A REGULATORY MANNER.

Scope: Graded surface irrigation systems include graded border and graded furrow irrigation systems.  Graded border irrigation systems allow irrigation water to flow across the soil surface while being confined by borders.  Graded furrow irrigation systems are systems that allow irrigation water to flow down furrow valleys while the crop being irrigated is planted on the furrow ridge. Generally graded border systems are suitable for small grains while graded furrow systems are suitable for row crops.


Description: The soil properties and qualities important in the design and management of graded surface irrigation systems are depth, available water holding capacity, sodium adsorption ratio, surface coarse fragments, permeability, salinity, slope, wetness, and flooding. Features that affect system performance and plant growth are salinity, sodium adsorption ratio, wetness, calcium carbonate content, and available water holding capacity. 

CRITERIA: The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features. 

1. Depth to cemented pan: Shallow depth to cemented pan limits site preparation such as shaping and leveling, reduces rooting depth and available water capacity, and restricts installation of underground irrigation practice components.  Soil features considered are the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restriction kind = ""fragipan"", ""duripan"", ""petrocalcic"", ""ortstein"", or ""petrogypsic"".  Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table.

			Not limiting not   = ""bedrock (paralithic)"" or ""bedrock (densic)""
	Null restrictive feature kind is assigned to the Not limiting class.

4. Depth to saturated zone: A shallow depth to water table will hamper installation of irrigation pipelines, appurtenances, water control structures, and earth forming that might be needed install and maintain graded surface irrigation systems.  A shallow depth to water table will also complicate the irrigation water management requirements for the site, and often increases probability of salinity problems developing.  A shallow water table will also make the soil difficult to work and restrict the rooting zone. These areas are slow to drain and can become waterlogged and boggy during periods of heavy precipitation. Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first layer where soil moisture layer status is wet or saturated during any month in the growing season. See reference for growing season definition. This limitation can sometimes be overcome with installation of a properly designed drainage system.  Used greater than or equal to 90 cm as not limiting based on NEH, Part 652, Irrigation Guide, and Exhibit 2.1.


	Property used: WMS - DEPTH TO HIGH WATER TABLE MINIMUM DURING THE GROWING SEASON (PAN) (Modality - high, low, representative value).Restrictive limits:
		Restrictive limits:

			Not limiting 		 = > 90cm
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.

5. Low Available Water Capacity:  Soils with low available water capacities have limited potential to hold irrigation water.  Irrigation management is critical on soil with low AWC to insure adequate soil water for maximum plant growth and production.

			Not limiting		=> 18 cm
	Null AWC is assigned to the Not rated class.

6. Sodium content: Soils with high sodium adsorption ratio are prone to develop irrigation water and rainfall infiltration restriction/reductions due to soil dispersion caused by sodium in the soil and/or soil water.  Soils with elevated SARs will require monitoring of SAR in soil and irrigation water being applied, very careful irrigation water management, possible chemical treatment.  An elevated SAR may impact expected crop response to irrigation by suppressing plant growth and will require a high degree of management. Soil feature considered is the highest sodium adsorption ratio for horizons that have any portion in the depth range 0 to 150cm.

	Property used: WMS - SODIUM ADSORPTION RATIO MAXIMUM IN DEPTH 0-150cm (PAN) (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		Restriction limits:
			Very limiting 		=> 20
			Somewhat limiting	  > 6 to < 20
			Not limiting 		<= 6
	Null SAR is assigned not rated.

7. Flooding:  Flooding frequency greater then rare has the potential to damage irrigation infrastructure, and impact expected crop response to irrigation by causing frequent crop damage.  Most irrigation systems involve a relatively high investment in money or labor or both. Most producers will need to be fairly certain the investment necessary to install an irrigation system will pay.  A frequently flooded area would not likely provide a very stable investment.  Frequently flooded areas are more likely to transport nutrients and agricultural chemicals, which are typically applied at a higher rate on irrigated land, Soil feature considered is maximum flooding frequency classes over 12 months.

	Property used: WMS - FLOODING FREQUENCY CLASS, Greatest ANY MONTH (PAN) (Maximum Duration) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		= Very frequent""
			Somewhat limiting	= ""occasional"" or "" frequent""
			Not limiting		= ""none"" or ""very rare"" or ""rare""
	Null frequency is assigned to the Not limiting class.

8. Content of large stones: Large stones impede installation of pipelines and water control structures, irrigation land leveling and/or shaping, and construction of earthen canals, ditches, or ridges.  Large stones may also impact operation and management requirements of graded surface irrigation system and will impact expected crop response to irrigation by effecting tillage, planting, and harvesting and plant growth through reduced soil AWC. Soil feature considered is the weighted average percentage of rock fragments of size greater than 75mm in horizons above a restrictive feature or from 0 to 100 cm deep.

	Property used: WMS - FRAGMENTS > 75MM WEIGHTED AVE. IN DEPTH 0-100CM (PAN) (Modality - high, low, representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting		 > 35 %
			Somewhat limiting	 > 25% to =<35 %
			Not limiting		=< 25 %
	Null fragment data are assigned Not rated.

9. Seepage: Soils with high hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) and low content of fine particles may have a seepage limitation that allows applied irrigation water to percolate rapidly below the root zone during and following irrigation.  High permeability is undesirable in graded surface irrigation systems and can significantly increase irrigation expense and labor requirements to overcome the limitation.  Timing, application rates, and application methods are management tools that can be used when applying these products to soil susceptible to SEEPAGE. Soil feature considered is the Ksat or to a restrictive layer if less then 150cm. 
 
	Property used: WMS - KSAT, THICKEST LAYER, 0 TO 150CM OR FIRST RESTRICTION (PAN) (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		Restriction limits:
			Very limiting 		 > 44.0 um/sec
			Somewhat limiting 	=> 14.1 um/sec and <= 44.0 um/sec
			Not limiting 		<= 14.1 um/sec
	Null Ksat is assigned not limiting.

10. Ponding: Ponding restricts or effects tillage, rooting depth, and plant growth. Ponding may damage irrigation infrastructure, and will likely impact expected crop response to irrigation by causing frequent crop damage.  Many irrigation systems involve a relatively high investment in money or labor or both. Most producers will need to be fairly certain the investment necessary to install an irrigation system will pay.  A ponding area would not likely provide a very stable investment. Soil feature considered is ponding duration during the growing season. This limitation can sometimes be overcome with installation of a properly designed drainage system.  

	Property used: WMS - PONDING DURATION DURING GROWING SEASON (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Very limiting 		= ""long"" or ""very long""
			Somewhat Limiting 	= brief or ""very brief""
			Not limiting	 	= ""none""
	Null ponding duration is assigned to the Not limiting class.

11. Excess salt: Soils with high electrical conductivity may suppress plant growth and will require a high degree of management. Soils with elevated salinity levels will require EC monitoring of soil and irrigation water being applied.  Matching irrigated crop selection to expected salinity levels, proper leaching, and careful irrigation water management, will be required on soils with elevated salinity. A properly designed drainage system may be required to properly irrigate some soils with elevated salinity levels.  Irrigation runoff and associated subsurface drainage from these soils has potential to increase salinity levels in groundwater, downstream surface waters, and wetlands.  Soil feature considered is the horizon with the highest electrical conductivity. 

	Property used: WMS - SALINITY MAXIMUM (PAN) (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		Restriction limits:

			Not limiting		  < 4
	Null EC is assigned not rated.

	Property used: WMS - SLOPE (PAN) (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		Restriction limits:
			Very Limiting		=> 3%
			Somewhat limiting	  > 1 and < 3%
			Not limiting		=< 1%			
	Null Slope is assigned Not rated.

13. Percs slowly: Soils with low surface hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) and smectitic mineralogy have slow percolation causing excess runoff and erosion during high precipitation or irrigation events. Agri-chemical and fertilizers applied to soil's with this limitation may be removed from the site by runoff and can impacting adjacent surface waters. Timing, application rates, and application methods are management tools that can be used when applying these products to soil susceptible to slow percolation. Soil feature considered is the horizon with the lowest Ksat that has any portion in the depth range 0 to 150cm or to a restrictive layer if less then 150cm. 

	Property used: WMS - KSAT MINIMUM, 0-150CM OR FIRST RESTRICTION (PAN) (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		Restriction limits: 
			Very limiting 		< 0.14 micrometers/second
			Somewhat limiting 	=> 0 .14 to < 1.4 micrometers/second
			Not limiting 		=> 1.4 um/sec
	Null Ksat is assigned not rated.

14. Soil Reaction:  (too acid or too alkaline) Low or High soil pH can result in corrosion of irrigation infrastructure, significantly increase in irrigation system operation and maintenance requirements, and impact expected crop response to irrigation by restricting plant growth. Soil feature considered is the (pH) from 0 to 150cm.
	
	Property used: WMS - SOIL REACTION 1-1 WATER; MINIMUM, 0 TO 100CM (PAN) AND SOIL REACTION 1-1 WATER; MAXIMUM, 0 TO 150CM (PAN) (Modality - high, low, representative value)
                        	Restriction limits:  Too acid
			Very limiting		=< 3.5
			Somewhat limiting 	  > 3.5 and <5.0
			Not limiting		=> 5.0
	Null pH values are assigned to the Not rated class.

		Restriction limits:  Too alkaline
			Somewhat limiting 	  > 9.0 
			Not limiting		=< 9.0
	Null pH values are assigned to the Not rated class.

			

15.  Calcium Carbonate: Soils with free carbonates below the surface layer will reduces irrigation efficiency and effectiveness by increasing irrigation intake rate from what would have been estimated based on texture alone  may restrict intake if compacted or equipment blockages from precipitation of calcium.  Free carbonates can also restrict available root zone of irrigated crops.   Soil feature considered is the maximum CaCO3 equivalent (pct in thickest layer) between 25 and 150cm (10 to 60 inches) or a restrictive layer.

	Property used: WMS - CaCO3 MAXIMUM 25-150CM OR FIRST RESTRICTION (PAN) (Modality - high, low, and representative value)
		Restrictive limits:
			Somewhat Limiting	=> 50%
			Not limiting		  < 50 %
	Null CaCO3 is assigned to the Not limiting class.

16. Erodes Easily: Surface soil water erodibility indicator is the product of the surface K factor multiplied by the soil slope. Soils are subject to water erosion if the indicator is above .98 and practice design should include water erosion control measures.  Soil features considered are the soil horizon K factor and the soil slope.

	Property used: WMS - SURFACE LAYER WATER EROSION IDICATOR (PAN) (Modality - representative value)
		Restriction limits:

			Somewhat limiting	  > 1.0 and < 3.0
			Not limiting		=< 1.0
	Null K factor is assigned Not rated.

17.  Subsidence:  The presence of gypsum or soluble salts in the soil, parent material, or bedrock may lead to the formation of subsidence features if the amount of irrigation water applied grossly exceeds evapotranspiration.  In humid climates, excessive irrigation on soils occuring over limestone bedrock can also experience sinkhole formation.  Soil features considered are the gypsum content of the soil and bedrock as well as the presence of limestone bedrock.

Summary: Soil interpretations for ""Surface Irrigation (Level)"" evaluate a soil's limitation(s) for basin, paddy, level furrow, or level border irrigation systems.  The ratings are for soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use.

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).  

This Irrigation Application is NOT DESIGNED OR INTENDED TO BE USED IN A REGULATORY MANNER.


Scope: Surface Irrigation Systems (Level) include basin, paddy, level furrow, or level border irrigation systems. Level surface irrigation systems are irrigation systems that use flood irrigation techniques to spread irrigation water at a specified depth across the application area.  Basin, paddy, and borders generally use external ridges or borders to confine the irrigation application while level furrow systems use furrow valleys and end blocks or border ridges to confine the irrigation application during irrigation.  With furrow irrigation the crop is usually planted on the furrow ridge. Generally, basin, paddy and level border irrigation systems are suitable for rice, small grain, pasture and forage production.  Level furrow systems are generally suited for row crops. 

Description: The soil properties and qualities important in the design and management of level surface irrigation systems are depth, available water holding capacity, sodium adsorption ratio, permeability, salinity, slope, and flooding.  The soil properties and qualities that influence installation are depth, flooding and ponding.  The features that affect performance of the system and plant growth are salinity, sodium adsorption ratio, and available water holding capacity.

4.  Content of large stones: Large stones may impede installation of pipelines and water control structures, irrigation land leveling and/or shaping, and construction of earthen canals, ditches, or ridges.  Stones will increase operation and management requirements, complicate repair of damaged irrigation system components, and impact expected crop response to irrigation by effecting tillage, planting, harvesting and plant growth through reduced soil AWC.  Soil feature considered is the weighted average percentage of rock fragments of size greater than 75mm in horizons above a restrictive feature or from 0 to 100 cm deep.


	Property used: WMS - FRAGMENTS > 75MM WEIGHTED AVE. IN DEPTH 0-100CM (PAN) (Modality - high, low, representative value)

			Not limiting		=< 25 %
	Null 3 to 10 inch rock fragment data are assigned to the Not rated class.

5. Depth to saturated zone: Soils with shallow depth to water will hamper installation of irrigation pipelines, appurtenances, water control structures, and earth forming that might be needed to install and maintain graded surface irrigation systems.  A shallow depth to water table will also complicate the irrigation water management requirements for the site, and often increases probability of salinity problems developing.  A shallow water table will also make the soil difficult to work and produce a restricted root zone. These areas are slow to drain and can become waterlogged and boggy during periods of heavy precipitation. Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first layer where soil moisture layer status is wet or saturated during any month in the growing season. See reference for growing season definition. This limitation can sometimes be overcome with installation of a properly designed drainage system.  Used greater than or equal to 90 cm as not limiting based on NEH, Part 652, Irrigation Guide, and Exhibit 2.1.

			Somewhat limiting	  > 7.5 to < 18cm
			Not limiting		=> 18cm
	Null AWC is assigned to the Not rated class. 

7.  Sodium content: Soils with high sodium adsorption ratio are prone to develop irrigation water and rainfall infiltration restriction/reductions due to soil dispersion caused by sodium in the soil and/or soil water.  Soils with elevated SARs will require monitoring of SAR in soil and irrigation water being applied, very careful irrigation water management, possible chemical treatment.  An elevated SAR may impact expected crop response to irrigation by suppressing plant growth and will require a high degree of management. Soil feature considered is the highest sodium adsorption ratio for horizons that have any portion in the depth range 0 to 150cm.

	Property used: WMS - SODIUM ADSORPTION RATIO MAXIMUM IN DEPTH 0-150cm (PAN) (Modality - low, high, representative value)

			Not limiting 		<= 6
	Null SAR is assigned not rated.

8.  Flooding: Flooding frequency greater then rare has the potential to damage irrigation infrastructure and impact expected crop response to irrigation by causing frequent crop damage.  Most irrigation systems involve a relatively high investment in money or labor or both. Most producers will need to be fairly certain the investment necessary to install an irrigation system will pay.  A frequently flooded area would not likely provide a very stable investment.  Frequently flooded areas are more likely to transport nutrients and agricultural chemicals, which are typically applied at a higher rate on irrigated land, off site to receiving surface waters. Soil feature considered is maximum flooding frequency classes over 12 months.

	Null frequency is assigned to the Not limiting class.

9.  Excess salt: Soils with high electrical conductivity may suppress plant growth and will require a high degree of management. Soils with elevated salinity levels will require EC monitoring of soil and irrigation water being applied.  Matching irrigated crop selection to expected salinity levels, proper leaching, and careful irrigation water management, will be required on soils with elevated salinity. A properly designed drainage system may be required to properly irrigate some soils with elevated salinity levels.  Irrigation runoff and associated subsurface drainage from these soils has potential to increase salinity levels in groundwater, downstream surface waters, and wetlands.  Soil feature considered is the horizon with the highest electrical conductivity.

	Null EC is assigned not rated.

10.  Seepage: Rapid permeability that allows irrigation water to percolate out of the root zone is undesirable and increase irrigation management expenses.  Permeability that maintains irrigation water within the root zone during the consumptive use period is desirable to maintain the growth and vigor of the irrigated crop. Soil feature considered is the horizon with the highest Ksat that has any portion in the depth range 0 to 150 cm or to a restrictive layer if less then 150 cm.

			Not limiting 		=> 1.4 um/sec
	Null Ksat is assigned not rated.

12. Ponding: Ponding may damage irrigation infrastructure, and will likely impact expected crop response to irrigation by causing frequent crop damage.  Most level surface irrigation systems involve a relatively high investment in money or labor or both. Most producers will need to be fairly certain the investment necessary to install an irrigation system will pay.  Leaving a ponding area would not likely provide a very stable investment.  Soil feature considered is ponding duration any month during the growing season. Soil feature considered is ponding duration.  This limitation can sometimes be overcome with irrigation land leveling or installation of a properly designed drainage system.  Soil feature considered is ponding duration.

			Somewhat limiting 	  > 3.5 and <5.0
			Not limiting		=> 5.0
	Null pH values are assigned to the Not rated class.

		Restriction limits:  Too alkaline
			Somewhat limiting 	  > 9.0 
			Not limiting		=< 9.0
	Null pH values are assigned to the Not rated class.


14.  Calcium Carbonate: Soils with free carbonates below the surface layer may reduce irrigation efficiency and effectiveness by increasing irrigation intake rate from what would have been estimated based on texture alone. Calcium Carbonate may restrict intake if compacted or equipment blockages from precipitation of calcium.  Free carbonates can also restrict available root zone of irrigated crops. Soil feature considered is the maximum CaCO3 equivalent (pct in thickest layer) between 25 and 150cm (10 to 60 inches) or a restrictive layer.

			Not limiting		=< 2 %			
	Null Slope is assigned Not rated.

16.  Subsidence:  The presence of gypsum or soluble salts in the soil, parent material, or bedrock may lead to the formation of subsidence features if the amount of irrigation water applied grossly exceeds evapotranspiration.  In humid climates, excessive irrigation on soils occuring over limestone bedrock can also experience sinkhole formation.  Soil features considered are the gypsum content of the soil and bedrock as well as the presence of limestone bedrock.

	Property used: ""LIMESTONE RESIDUUM TES""  (Modality - and representative value)

CO643,WMS - Pond Reservoir Area,limitation,"Summary:

Soil interpretations for various water management practices are developed for use in evaluating the potential of the soil for various water management practices.  These practices may involve the movement of water to or from a site, holding water on a site, or securing a water source.  The soil survey interpretation rating guides are applicable to both heavily and sparsely populated areas, depending upon the objectives of the user.  The ratings are for soils in their present condition and do not consider present land use.  Soil limitation ratings and associated restrictive features are given for ponds and reservoir areas; embankments, dikes, and levees; and excavated ponds.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""WMS - Pond Reservoir Area"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Off-Road Motorcycle Trails"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

A pond reservoir area is an area that holds water behind a dam or embankment.  Livestock or wildlife watering facilities are examples of the potential application of pond reservoir areas.

Soil properties influence development of pond reservoir areas including site selection, structure design, construction, performance, and after construction maintenance.  The soil interpretations for pond reservoir areas are used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for the practice.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Scope: National

The soils best suited to this use have a low seepage potential, which is determined by permeability and depth to fractured or permeable bedrock, to a cemented pan, or to other permeable material.

Ratings are based on soil properties and qualities to act as a natural barrier against seepage into deeper layers, without regard to cutoff trenches or other features that may be installed under the pond embankment.  Excessive slope in the direction perpendicular to the axis of the pond embankment seriously reduces the storage capacity of the reservoir area.  Suitable sites may be difficult to find on slopes steeper than about 10 percent.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

	1.  Seepage:  The soil horizon with the maximum Ksat governs the seepage potential of the soil.   When this rate is high, transmission of fluids into and through the soil is unimpeded and seepage may become a performance concern.

CO643,"WMS - Subsurface Water Management, Outflow Quality",limitation,"WMS - Water Management System, Outflow Quality

Summary: Soil interpretations for ""WMS - Water Management System, Outflow Quality"" evaluate a soil's limitations for outflow quality from conservation systems that involve the movement or conveyance of surface water across the landscape and excess subsurface water from the soil. Such conveyances are graded ditches, grassed waterways, terraces, diversions, tile drains and underground outlets etc. The ratings are for soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use. 

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limited condition) and 1.0 (limited condition). If a soil property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater than zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified. The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule. Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less than the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation. These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.  Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation. These are not limited (degree of limitation= 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0). or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).

Summary: Soil interpretations for ""WMS  Subsurface Water Management, System Installation"" evaluate a soil's limitation(s) for systems that involve installation of underground drainage systems. These systems are designed to remove excess subsurface water from the soil and reduce soil saturation. The ratings are for soils in their natural condition. and do not consider present land use.
 
The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (1imiting condition). If a soil's property within 125 cm (49 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater than zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified. The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule. Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less than the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation. These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation. These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation> 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0). 



Scope: The soil interpretation for ""WMS - Subsurface Water Management, System Installation"" is designed to be used as a tool in evaluating and identifying soil limitations for installation of subsurface drainage systems that involve installation of underground drainage pipe, tile, or tubing. As part of the interpretation process, the rating applies to each soil in its undisturbed condition and does not consider present land use. The limitation rating provided is based on the influence of existing soil properties on installation of Subsurface Water Management structures. 
 


Description: Subsurface drainage is the process of removing excess subsurface water from agricultural land. How easily and effectively a subsurface water management structure can be installed depends on the depth to bedrock or to a cemented pan, soil texture, stability of excavations, coarse fragments and slope.

6. Unstable excavation walls:  Under certain circumstances, the sides of an excavation may collapse.  This can be hazardous to anyone in the trench or near the edge at the time of failure.  The sloughed material may need to be removed from the trench, increasing the time needed to excavate.  The sides of the trench may need to be made to reflect the angle of repose of the material or be shored.

Note

The original national ""Tile Drains and Underground Outlet"" interpretation was published in Part 
620, Soil Interpretation Rating Guides, of the National Soil Survey Handbook (1993 version). The 
national interpretation was dropped in the late 1990s. The original interpretation rules and 
criteria were modified and adapted to reflect Texas needs and converted to a state soil 
interpretation, ""WMS Tile Drains and Underground Outlets."" This interpretation was subjected to 
national review and is proposed for reestablishment as a National Soil Interpretation, ""WMS

Summary: Soil interpretations for ""WMS  Subsurface Water Management, System Performance"" evaluate a soil's limitation(s) for systems that involve performance and functionality of underground drainage systems. These systems are designed to remove excess subsurface water from the soil and reduce soil saturation. The ratings are for soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use.
 
The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition). If a soil's property within 150 cm (59 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater than zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified. The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule. Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less than the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support 
the interpretation. These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications. 

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation. These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation> 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).
 

 
Scope: The soil interpretation for ""WMS - Subsurface Water Management, System Performance"" is designed to be used as a tool in evaluating and identifying soil limitations for performance of subsurface drainage systems that involve functionality of underground drainage pipe, tile, or tubing. As part of the interpretation process, the rating applies to each soil in its undisturbed condition and does not consider present land use. The limitation rating provided is based on the influence of existing soil properties on performance of Subsurface Water Management structures. 
 
Description: Subsurface drainage is the process of removing excess subsurface water from agricultural land. How easily and effectively a subsurface water management structure can performed depend on the depth to dense layer, slow percolation, soil reaction, excess salts, excess sodium, subsidence, excess gypsum, sedimentation, water table depth, and flooding. 

         Criteria: The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.
  A. A water table must be present. Monthly recorded water table within 125 cm (4 ft) from surface must occur in one or more months or else ""drainage normally not required. 

          AND

B. Performance and Functionality 

1. Dense layer:  This subrule deals with the relationship between soil bulk density and water movement.  As bulk density increases, water movement is incrementally limited and percolatio reduced.  At some point, water can no longer penetrate the soil and the bulk density becomes not just a limitor, but a restriction.  Bulk density is related to the texture of the soil, with sandy textured soils typically being denser than silty or clayey soils.  Silty soils are non-limiting over a wider range of bulk density than sandy or clayey soils.  Bulk density, therefore, is expressed as a ratio of the difference of the existing bulk density minus an optimal bulk density for each sand, silt, and clay combination divided by the theoretical difference between the water restricting bulk density minus the optimal bulk density at each combination of sand silt and clay.

Property used:  BULK DENSITY RATIO MAXIMUM 150CM OR RESTRICTION, Modality representative value


Restrictive Limits:
                                     Not limiting                < 0.8
                                     Somewhat limiting           >=0.8 to < 1.2
                                     Very limiting               >=1.2

Null bulk density is assigned to the ""not rated"" class.

     OR 

2. PERCS SLOWLY: Soils with low hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) have slow percolation causing excess runoff   and erosion during high precipitation or irrigation events. Tile drains installed in soils with this limitation may not perform as water percolate too slowly to the tile depth. Soil feature considered is the Ksat in the depth range 0 to 150 cm.

     NULL data are assigned to the ""not rated"" class.

3. Flooding: Flooding frequency greater than rare has the potential to damage drainage infrastructure and impact expected crop response to drainage by causing frequent crop damaged. Soil feature considered is maximum flooding frequency classes over 12 months. 

Property used: ""FLOODING FREQUENCY CLASS, Greatest ANY MONTH 
        (Maximum Duration)"" (Modality - representative value)

	Somewhat limited 	= ""occasional"" or"" frequent"" 
	Not limited 	= ""none"" or ""very rare"" or ""rare""

      Property used: SOIL REACTION 1-1 WATER; MINIMUM, 0 TO 150 CM, Modality: Representative Value

	Restriction limits: Too acid
		Very limited   = < 3.5
		Somewhat limited > 3.5 and <5.0
		Not limited	=> 5.0
Null pH values are assigned to the ""not rated"" class


OR

5. Alkaline pH: High soil pH increases metallic ion and nutrient availability and restricts plant growth. Infrastructure corrosion potential increases as pH increases. Soil feature considered is soil reaction (pH) from 0 to 180 cm.

     Property used: SOIL REACTION 1-1 WATER; MAXIMUM, 0-150CM, Modality: Representative Value

     NULL data are assigned to the  ""not rated"" class.

OR
6. Excess Salt: Excess water-soluble salts may dissolve into water flowing to and through the subsurface drain.

	Not limited 	       =< 4 
Null EC is assigned to the ""not rated"" class. 

OR 

7. Excess Sodium: Soils with high sodium adsorption ratio may disperse, limiting the flow of water to the tile, and suppress plant growth and will require a high degree of management. Soil feature considered is the highest sodium adsorption ratio for horizons that have any portion in the depth range 0 to 150 cm.

Property used: SODIUM ADSORPTION RATIO MAXIMUM IN DEPTH 0-150CM,  Modality: Representative Value

     Restrictive limits:
          Very limited              >= 13 
          Somewhat limited     > 4.5 to < 13
          Not limited               <= 4. 5

 Null SAR is assigned to the ""not rated"" class.

OR

8. SUBSIDENCE: NSSH 618.59, B, 1-3. The susceptibility of soils to subsidence is an important consideration for organic soils that are drained. If these soils are drained for community development, special foundations are needed for buildings. Utility lines, sidewalks, and roads that lack special foundations may settle at different rates, thus causing breakage, high maintenance costs, and inconvenience. If the soils are drained for farming, the long-term effects of subsidence, the possible destruction of land if it subsides below the water table must be considered. Subsidence as a result of drainage is attributed to the following factors. The first three factors are responsible for the initial subsidence that occurs rapidly, specifically within about 3 years after the water table is lowered.
     	-Shrinkage from drying,
     	-Consolidation due to loss of ground-water buoyancy,
     	-Compaction from tillage or manipulation,
    	 -Wind erosion,
     	-Burning,
     	-Biochemical oxidation.
After the initial subsidence, a degree of stability is reached and the loss of elevation declines to a steady rate, primarily because of oxidation. The oxidation and subsidence continue at this slower rate until stopped by the water table or underlying mineral material. The rate of subsidence depends on
     	-Ground-water depth,
    	 -Amount of organic matter,
     	-Kind of organic matter,
     	-Soil temperature,
     	-pH,
     	-Biochemical activity.
Soil feature considered is total subsidence.

Property used: SUBSIDENCE TOTAL,  Modality: Representative Value
Restrictive limits:
          Very limited    >= 30 cm
          Not limited     < 30 cm
     	NULL data are assigned to the ""not limited"" class.

OR

9. EXCESS GYPSUM: Excess gypsum may dissolve into water flowing through the subsurface drain and cause subsidence or piping of the drain. It may also contaminate subsurface water at the discharge of the drain. Soil feature considered is the maximum gypsum percent between 0 and 150 cm or a restrictive layer.

Property used: GYPSUM MAXIMUM 0-150CM OR FIRST RESTRICTION,   Modality: Representative Value
    	 Restrictive limits:
          Very limited               >= 40%
          Somewhat limited     > 5 to < 40%
          Not limited          <= 5%
     	NULL data are assigned to the ""not limited"" class.

OR

10. SEDIMENTATION: Sedimentation is the tendency for particles in suspension to settle out of the fluid in which they are entrained, and come to rest against a barrier. This is due to their motion through the fluid in response to the forces acting on them: these forces can be due to gravity, centrifugal acceleration or electromagnetism. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedimentation) There is typically not enough energy in the system to transport particles larger than fine sand in suspension. As energy (flow) rates vary the fine sand and very fine sand fractions settle out first when energy is reduced while the smaller particle fractions tend to stay in suspension longer and be transported further. The accumulation of the fine sand and very fine sand fraction may reduce tile drain capacity and potentially compromise the performance of tile drains. The soil feature considered is the maximum amount of fine sand plus very fine sand in horizons that have less than 12 percent total clay in the depth range 60 to 125 cm.

Property used: USDA TEXTURE FS+VFS WHEN <12% C, MAX IN DEPTH 60-125CM,   Modality: Representative Value

          Somewhat limited      > 20 and < 50%
          Not limited                 <=20%
     NULL fine and very fine sand data are assigned to the ""not rated"" class.

 AND

Interpretation Rating Guides, of the National Soil Survey Handbook (1993 version). The national interpretation was dropped in the late 1990s.

Summary: Soil interpretations for ""WMS - Surface Water Management, System"" evaluate a soil's limitations for conservation systems that involve the movement or conveyance of surface water across the landscape. Such conveyances are graded ditches, grassed waterways, terraces, diversions, etc. The ratings are for soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use.
 
The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limited condition) and 1.0 (limited condition).  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater than zero, then that soil property is limited and the soil restrictive feature is identified. The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule. Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less than the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation. These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.
 
Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation. These are not limited (degree of limitation= 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0). or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).
 
Scope: The soil interpretation for WMS- Surface Water Management, System is designed to be used as a tool in evaluating and identifying soil limitations for the installation and performance of surface drainage systems involving construction of earthen drainage ditches, channels, diversions, terraces, etc that involve <60cm of cut. As part of the interpretation process the rating applies to each soil in its undisturbed condition and does not consider present land use. The limitation rating provided is based on the influence of existing soil properties on installation and function of these systems. Where there is concern about construction of drainage structures that involve> 60cm of cut, soil should be checked for bedrock or other restriction to planned excavation depth.
 
Description: Soil properties and qualities that affect construction and performance of Surface Water Management Structures (Ditch, Channel, or Ridge) are slope, flooding, ponding, surface and subsurface permeability, surface coarse fragments, depth to restrictive feature (bedrock, pan, or dense layer), sodium, salinity, gypsum, and susceptibility to water erosion.

	Not limited             =< 5% 
Null fragment data are assigned to the ""not rated"" class. 

4. Slope: Slopes more than gently sloping impede the performance of a surface drain and remove water at a velocity that may exceed soil resistance to erosion.
 
Property used: SLOPE,  (Modality -low, high, representative value)
Restriction limits: 
	Very limited             => 6% 
	Somewhat limited    > 3 and < 6% 
	Not limited               =< 3% 

Null Slope is assigned to the ""not rated"" class.
 
5. Flooding: Flooding frequency greater then occasional restricts installation of drainage structures and inhibits free flow of surface water from the drainage area. Soil feature considered is maximum flooding frequency classes over 12 months. 

Property used: FLOODING FREQUENCY CLASS, Greatest (Maximum Duration), (Modality - representative value)

	Restrictive limits: 
	Very Limited            = ""very frequent""  
	Somewhat limited    = ""frequent"" 
	Not limited               = ""none"" or ""very rare, rare, or occasional

Null frequency is assigned to the ""not limited"" class.

	

6. Ponding: Ponding frequency greater than ""occasional"" restricts installation of drainage structures and inhibits free flow of surface water from the drainage area. Soil feature considered is maximum ponding frequency classes over 12 months.
 
Property used: Ponding FREQUENCY CLASS, Greatest (Maximum Duration),   (Modality - representative value) 
	Restrictive limits:
                           Very limited             = very frequent
	           Somewhat limited    = frequent
	           Not limited               = ""none"" or ""rare"" or ""occasional""
	 	 
Null frequency is assigned to the ""not limited"" class.


 
7. Rapid percolation: The slow movement of water through the surface layers of the soil limits percolation of surface water into the subsoil and supports the performance and function of the surface drain.
 
Property used: KSAT MINIMUM IN DEPTH O-50 CM,  (Modality - low, high, representative value) 
Restriction limits: 
	Very limited             => 14 micrometers/second 
	Somewhat limited   > 1.4 and < 14 micrometers/second 
	Not limited               =< 1.4 micrometers/second
 
Null Ksat is assigned to the ""not limited"" class. 
 
 
8. Excess salt: Excess water-soluble salts may dissolve into water flowing through the surfaces drain and contaminate surface water at the discharge of the drain.
 
Property used: SALINITY MAXIMUM IN DEPTH 0-50CM, (Modality -Low, high, representative value) 
Restriction limits: 
	Very limited            => 16 mmhos/cm
	Somewhat limited   > 4 to < 16 mmhos/cm
	Not limited              =< 4 mmhos/cm
Null EC is assigned to the ""not rated"" class.
 
9. Sodium content: Soils with high sodium adsorption ratio are prone to develop dispersive soil conditions in channel banks causing significant maintenance issues, as well as, infiltration restriction/reductions due to soil dispersion caused by sodium in the soil and/or soil water. Surface drainage from these soils has potential to increase sodium levels in groundwater, downstream surface waters, and wetlands. Soil feature considered is the highest sodium adsorption ratio for horizons that have any portion in the depth range 0 to 60 cm.
 
Property used: SODIUM ADSORPTION RATIO MAXIMUM IN DEPTH 0- 60 cm, (Modality - low, high, representative value) 
	Restriction limits: 		 
	Very limited                => 20  
	Somewhat limited      > 6 to < 20 	 
	Not limited                 <= 6  
Null SAR is assigned to the ""not rated"" class.
 
10. Excess gypsum: Excess gypsum may dissolve into water flowing through the surface drain and cause subsidence or piping of the drain. It may also contaminate surface water at the discharge of the drain. Soil feature considered is the maximum. gypsum percent between 0 and 50cm (0 to 20 inches) or a restrictive layer. 


Property used: GYPSUM MAXIMUM 0-50CM OR FIRST RESTRICTION, (Modality - low, high, representative value)  
	Restriction limits:  
	Very limited             => 40% 
	Somewhat limited   > 1 to < 40%  
	Not limited               =< 1% 	

Null gypsum is assigned to the ""not limited"" class. 



11. Erodes Easily: Surface soil water erodibility indicator is the product of the surface K factor multiplied by the soil slope. Channel banks and bottoms are subject to water erosion if the indicator is above 0.98 and practice design should include water erosion control measures. Soil features considered are the soil horizon K factor and the soil slope. 

 
Property used: SURFACE LAYER WATER EROSION INDICATOR, (Modality - representative value) 
Restriction limits: 
	Very Limited             => 3.0
	Somewhat limited    > 1.0 and < 3.0
