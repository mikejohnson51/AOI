58,Yields of Irrigated Crops (Component),cocropyld,irryield_r,Float,NA,2,"These are the estimated average yields per acre that can be expected of selected irrigated crops under a high level of management. In any given year, yields may be higher or lower than those indicated because of variations in rainfall and other climatic factors. It is assumed that the irrigation system is adapted to the soils and to the crops grown, that good-quality irrigation water is uniformly applied as needed, and that tillage is kept to a minimum.

In the database, some states maintain crop yield data by individual map unit component and others maintain the data at the map unit level. Attributes are included in this application for both, although only one or the other is likely to have data for any given geographic area. This attribute uses data maintained at the map unit component level.

The yields are actually recorded as three separate values in the database. A low value and a high value indicate the range for the soil component. A ""representative"" value indicates the expected value for the component. For these yields, only the representative value is used.

The yields are based mainly on the experience and records of farmers, conservationists, and extension agents. Available yield data from nearby areas and results of field trials and demonstrations also are considered.

The management needed to obtain the indicated yields of the various crops depends on the kind of soil and the crop. Management can include drainage, erosion control, and protection from flooding; the proper planting and seeding rates; suitable high-yielding crop varieties; appropriate and timely tillage; control of weeds, plant diseases, and harmful insects; favorable soil reaction and optimum levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and trace elements for each crop; effective use of crop residue, barnyard manure, and green manure crops; and harvesting that ensures the smallest possible loss.

2660,Minnesota Crop Productivity Index,mutext,text,Narrative Text,NA,NA,"The Minnesota Crop Productivity Index (CPI) ratings provide a relative ranking of soils based on their potential for intensive row crop production.  An index can be used to rate the potential yield of one soil against that of another over a period of time.  Ratings range from 0 to 100.  The higher numbers indicate higher production potential.

The CPI ratings do not take into account climatic factors, such as the differences in precipitation or growing degree days across Minnesota.  The ratings are based on physical and chemical properties of the soils and on such hazards and flooding and ponding.  Available water capacity, reaction (pH), slopes, soil moisture status, cation-exchange capacity (CEC), organic matter content, salinity, and surface fragments are the major properties evaluated when CPI ratings are generated.  The soil properties selected are those that are important for the production of corn.

All map units in Minnesota were initially evaluated using the Cropland Productivity rule in the National Soil Information System (NASIS).  They were assigned a value using an overall CPI based on the combined properties and characteristics of the map unit as a whole, and the values were adjusted based on tacit knowledge of local experts.  An individual map unit (for example, Canisteo clay loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes) will have the same CPI value wherever that map unit occurs throughout the state.

When the soils are rated, the following assumptions are made:  a) adequate management, b) no irrigation, c) artificial drainage where required, d) no land leveling or terracing, and e) no climatic factors considered. 

The map unit CPI was used to update the map unit crop yields for corn and soybeans.

46,Corrosion of Steel,component,corsteel,Choice,254,NA,"""Risk of corrosion"" pertains to potential soil-induced electrochemical or chemical action that corrodes or weakens uncoated steel. The rate of corrosion of uncoated steel is related to such factors as soil moisture, particle-size distribution, acidity, and electrical conductivity of the soil. Special site examination and design may be needed if the combination of factors results in a severe hazard of corrosion. The steel in installations that intersect soil boundaries or soil layers is more susceptible to corrosion than the steel in installations that are entirely within one kind of soil or within one soil layer.

The risk of corrosion is expressed as ""low,"" ""moderate,"" or ""high.""",,,Property,,NA,,0,1,0,0,corrosion_uncoated_steel,1,,,1,CorSteel,,,,,,,,0,,NA,NA,,0,,,Weighted Average,0,0,,1,2,NA,"<Map_Legend maplegendkey=""2""><ColorRampType type=""2"" name=""Defined"" /><Legend_Symbols shapeType=""polygon""><Styles fillStyle=""esriSFSSolid"" /><Font type=""Times New Roman"" size=""8"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /><Line type=""outline"" width=""0.4"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /></Legend_Symbols><Legend_Elements transparency=""0""><Labels value=""High"" label=""High"" order=""1""><Color red=""255"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /></Labels><Labels value=""Moderate"" label=""Moderate"" order=""2""><Color red=""255"" green=""255"" blue=""0"" /></Labels><Labels value=""Low"" label=""Low"" order=""3""><Color red=""0"" green=""255"" blue=""0"" /></Labels></Legend_Elements></Map_Legend>",1,02/28/2007 14:17:09,Dominant Condition,NA,1,Choice
40,"Lawns, Landscaping, and Golf Fairways",cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"This interpretation rates soils for their use in establishing and maintaining turf for lawns and golf fairways and ornamental trees and shrubs for residential or commercial landscaping. Lawns and landscaping require soils on which turf and ornamental trees and shrubs can be established and maintained. Golf fairways are subject to heavy foot traffic and some light vehicular traffic. Cutting or filling may be required. 

The ratings are based on the use of soil material at the site, which may have been altered by some land smoothing. Irrigation may or may not be needed and is not a criterion in rating. The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect plant growth and trafficability after vegetation is established. The properties that affect plant growth are reaction; depth to a water table; ponding; depth to bedrock or a cemented pan; the available water capacity in the upper 40 inches; the content of salts, sodium, or calcium carbonate; and sulfidic materials. The properties that affect trafficability are flooding, depth to a water table, ponding, slope, stoniness, and the amount of sand, clay, or organic matter in the surface layer. The suitability of the soil for traps, tees, roughs, and greens is not considered in the ratings.

Not considered in the ratings, but important in evaluating a site, are the location and accessibility of the area, the size and shape of the area and its scenic quality, vegetation, access to water, potential water impoundment sites, and access to public sewer lines. Soils that are subject to flooding are limited by the duration and intensity of flooding and the season when flooding occurs. In planning for lawns, landscaping, or golf fairways, onsite assessment of the height, duration, intensity, and frequency of flooding is essential.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect the specified use. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected. ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation. Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected. ""Very limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for the specified use. The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive installation procedures. Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected.

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (0.00).

79,Sand Source,cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"Sand is a natural aggregate (0.05 millimeter to 2 millimeters in diameter) suitable for commercial use with a minimum of processing. It is used in many kinds of construction. Specifications for each use vary widely. Only the probability of finding material in suitable quantity is evaluated. The suitability of the material for specific purposes is not evaluated, nor are factors that affect excavation of the material.

The properties used to evaluate the soil as a source of sand are gradation of grain sizes (as indicated by the Unified classification of the soil), the thickness of suitable material, and the content of rock fragments. If the bottom layer of the soil contains sand, the soil is considered a likely source regardless of thickness. The assumption is that the sand layer below the depth of observation exceeds the minimum thickness. The ratings are for the whole soil, from the surface to a depth of about 6 feet.

The soils are rated ""good,"" ""fair,"" or ""poor"" as potential sources of sand. A rating of ""good"" or ""fair"" means that sand is likely to be in or below the soil. The bottom layer and the thickest layer of the soil are assigned numerical ratings. These ratings indicate the likelihood that the layer is a source of sand. The number 0.00 indicates that the layer is a ""poor source."" The number 1.00 indicates that the layer is a ""good source."" A number between 0.00 and 1.00 indicates the degree to which the layer is a likely source.

43,Topsoil Source,cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"Topsoil is used to cover an area so that vegetation can be established and maintained. The surface layer of most soils is generally preferred for topsoil because of its content of organic matter. Organic matter greatly increases the absorption and retention of moisture and nutrients for plant growth.

The upper 40 inches of a soil is evaluated for use as topsoil. Also evaluated is the reclamation potential of the borrow area. Normal compaction, minor processing, and other standard construction practices are assumed.

The soils are rated ""good,"" ""fair,"" or ""poor"" as potential sources of topsoil. The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect plant growth; the ease of excavating, loading, and spreading the material; and reclamation of the borrow area. Toxic substances, soil reaction, and the properties that are inferred from soil texture, such as available water capacity and fertility, affect plant growth. The ease of excavating, loading, and spreading is affected by rock fragments, slope, depth to a water table, soil texture, and thickness of suitable material. Reclamation of the borrow area is affected by slope, depth to a water table, rock fragments, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, and toxic material.

Numerical ratings between 0.00 and 0.99 are given after the specified features. These numbers indicate the degree to which the features limit the soils as sources of topsoil. The lower the number, the greater the limitation.

20,Source of Reclamation Material,cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"Reclamation material is used in areas that have been drastically disturbed by surface mining or similar activities. When these areas are reclaimed, layers of soil material or unconsolidated geological material, or both, are replaced in a vertical sequence. The reconstructed soil favors plant growth. The ratings do not apply to quarries or other mined areas that require an offsite source of reconstruction material. The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect erosion and stability of the surface and the productive potential of the reclaimed soil. These properties include the content of sodium, salts, and calcium carbonate; reaction; available water capacity; erodibility; texture; content of rock fragments; and content of organic matter and other features that affect fertility.

The soils are rated ""good,"" ""fair,"" or ""poor"" as potential sources of reclamation material. The ratings are based on the amount of suitable material and on soil properties that affect the ease of excavation and the performance of the material after it is in place. The thickness of the suitable material is a major consideration. The ease of excavation is affected by large stones, depth to a water table, and slope. How well the soil performs in place after it has been compacted and drained is determined by its strength (as inferred from the AASHTO classification of the soil) and linear extensibility (shrink-swell potential). Normal compaction, minor processing, and other standard construction practices are assumed.

When the material is properly used in reclamation, a rating of ""good"" means that establishing and maintaining vegetation are relatively easy, that the surface is stable and resists erosion, and that the reclaimed soil has good potential productivity. A rating of ""fair"" means that vegetation can be established and maintained and the soil can be stabilized through modification of one or more properties. For satisfactory performance, it may be necessary to topdress with better suited material or add soil amendments. A rating of ""poor"" means that revegetation and stabilization are very difficult and costly. To establish and maintain vegetation, it is necessary to topdress with better suited material.

22,Gravel Source,cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"Gravel consists of natural aggregates (2 to 75 millimeters in diameter) suitable for commercial use with a minimum of processing. It is used in many kinds of construction. Specifications for each use vary widely. Only the probability of finding material in suitable quantity is evaluated. The suitability of the material for specific purposes is not evaluated, nor are factors that affect excavation of the material.

The properties used to evaluate the soil as a source of gravel are gradation of grain sizes (as indicated by the Unified classification of the soil), the thickness of suitable material, and the content of rock fragments. If the bottom layer of the soil contains gravel, the soil is considered a likely source regardless of thickness. The assumption is that the gravel layer below the depth of observation exceeds the minimum thickness. The ratings are for the whole soil, from the surface to a depth of about 6 feet. Coarse fragments of soft bedrock, such as shale and siltstone, are not considered to be gravel.

The soils are rated ""good,"" ""fair,"" or ""poor"" as potential sources of gravel. A rating of ""good"" or ""fair"" means that the source material is likely to be in or below the soil. The bottom layer and the thickest layer of the soils are assigned numerical ratings. These ratings indicate the likelihood that the layer is a source of gravel. The number 0.00 indicates that the layer is a poor source. The number 1.00 indicates that the layer is a good source. A number between 0.00 and 1.00 indicates the degree to which the layer is a likely source.

Slope and stoniness are the main concerns affecting the development of picnic areas. For good trafficability, the surface of picnic areas should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under heavy foot traffic, and not be dusty when dry.

The soil properties that affect the growth of plants are depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), and toxic substances in the soil.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect the specified use. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected. ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use.

103,Daily Cover for Landfill,cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"Daily cover for landfill is the soil material that is used to cover compacted solid waste in a sanitary landfill. The soil material is obtained offsite, transported to the landfill, and spread over the waste. The ratings also apply to the final cover for a landfill. They are based on the soil properties that affect workability, the ease of digging, and the ease of moving and spreading the material over the refuse daily during wet and dry periods. These properties include soil texture, depth to a water table, ponding, rock fragments, slope, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, reaction, and content of salts, sodium, or lime.

Loamy or silty soils that are free of large stones and excess gravel are the best cover for a landfill. Clayey soils may be sticky and difficult to spread; sandy soils are subject to wind erosion.

Slope affects the ease of excavation and of moving the cover material. Also, it can influence runoff, erosion, and reclamation of the borrow area. 

The soil material used as the final cover for a landfill should be suitable for plants. It should not have excess sodium, salts, or lime and should not be too acid. After soil material has been removed, the soil material remaining in the borrow area must be thick enough over bedrock, a cemented pan, or the water table to permit revegetation. Some damage to the borrow area is expected, however, and plant growth may not be optimum.

This information is intended for land use planning, for evaluating land use alternatives, and for planning site investigations prior to design and construction. The information, however, has limitations. For example, estimates and other data generally apply only to that part of the soil between the surface and a depth of 5 to 7 feet. Because of the map scale, small areas of different soils may be included within the mapped areas of a specific soil.

The information is not site specific and does not eliminate the need for onsite investigation of the soils or for testing and analysis by personnel experienced in the design and construction of engineering works.

Government ordinances and regulations that restrict certain land uses or impose specific design criteria were not considered in preparing the ratings. Local ordinances and regulations should be considered in planning, in site selection, and in design.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect these uses. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected. ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation. Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected. ""Very limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for the specified use. The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive installation procedures. Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected.

Numerical ratings in the table indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (0.00).

The map unit components listed for each map unit in the accompanying Summary by Map Unit table in Web Soil Survey or the Aggregation Report in Soil Data Viewer are determined by the aggregation method chosen.

90,Sanitary Landfill (Trench),cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"A ""trench sanitary landfill"" is an area where solid waste is placed in successive layers in an excavated trench. The waste is spread, compacted, and covered daily with a thin layer of soil excavated at the site. When the trench is full, a final cover of soil material at least 2 feet thick is placed over the landfill. A landfill must be able to bear heavy vehicular traffic. It can result in the pollution of ground water. Ease of excavation and revegetation should be considered.

The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect the risk of pollution, the ease of excavation, trafficability, and revegetation. These properties include saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, depth to a water table, ponding, slope, flooding, texture, stones and boulders, highly organic layers, soil reaction, and content of salts and sodium. Unless otherwise stated, the ratings apply only to that part of the soil within a depth of about 6 feet. For deeper trenches, onsite investigation may be needed.

Hard, nonrippable bedrock, creviced bedrock, or highly permeable strata at or directly below the proposed trench bottom can affect the ease of excavation and the hazard of ground-water pollution. Slope affects construction of the trenches and the movement of surface water around the landfill. It also affects the construction and performance of roads in areas of the landfill.

Soil texture and consistence affect the ease with which the trench is dug and the ease with which the soil can be used as daily or final cover. They determine the workability of the soil when dry and when wet. Soils that are plastic and sticky when wet are difficult to excavate, grade, or compact and are difficult to place as a uniformly thick cover over a layer of refuse.

The soil material used as the final cover for a trench landfill should be suitable for plants. It should not have excess sodium or salts and should not be too acid. The surface layer generally has the best workability, the highest content of organic matter, and the best potential for plants. Material from the surface layer should be stockpiled for use as the final cover.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect the specified use. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected. ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use.

84,Sewage Lagoons,cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"Sewage lagoons are shallow ponds constructed to hold sewage while aerobic bacteria decompose the solid and liquid wastes. Lagoons should have a nearly level floor surrounded by cut slopes or embankments of compacted soil. Nearly impervious soil material for the lagoon floor and sides is required to minimize seepage and contamination of ground water. Considered in the ratings are slope, saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), depth to a water table, ponding, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, large stones, and content of organic matter.

Ksat is a critical property affecting the suitability for sewage lagoons. Most porous soils eventually become sealed when they are used as sites for sewage lagoons. Until sealing occurs, however, the hazard of pollution is severe. Soils that have a Ksat rate of more than 14 micrometers per second are too porous for the proper functioning of sewage lagoons. In these soils, seepage of the effluent can result in contamination of the ground water. Ground-water contamination is also a hazard if fractured bedrock is within a depth of 40 inches, if the water table is high enough to raise the level of sewage in the lagoon, or if floodwater overtops the lagoon.

A high content of organic matter is detrimental to proper functioning of the lagoon because it inhibits aerobic activity. Slope, bedrock, and cemented pans can cause construction problems, and large stones can hinder compaction of the lagoon floor. If the lagoon is to be uniformly deep throughout, the slope must be gentle enough and the soil material must be thick enough over bedrock or a cemented pan to make land smoothing practical.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect the specified use. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected.

62,Sanitary Landfill (Area),cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"In an ""area sanitary landfill,"" solid waste is placed in successive layers on the surface of the soil. The waste is spread, compacted, and covered daily with a thin layer of soil from a source away from the site. A final cover of soil material at least 2 feet thick is placed over the completed landfill. A landfill must be able to bear heavy vehicular traffic. It can result in the pollution of ground water. Ease of excavation and revegetation should be considered.

The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect trafficability and the risk of pollution. These properties include flooding, saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), depth to a water table, ponding, slope, and depth to bedrock or a cemented pan. Flooding is a serious problem because it can result in pollution in areas downstream from the landfill. If Ksat is too rapid or if fractured bedrock, a fractured cemented pan, or the water table is close to the surface, the leachate can contaminate the water supply. Slope is a consideration because of the extra grading required to maintain roads in the steeper areas of the landfill. Also, leachate may flow along the surface of the soils in the steeper areas and cause difficult seepage problems.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect the specified use. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected.

18,Septic Tank Absorption Fields,cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"Septic tank absorption fields are areas in which effluent from a septic tank is distributed into the soil through subsurface tiles or perforated pipe. Only that part of the soil between depths of 24 and 60 inches is evaluated. The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect absorption of the effluent, construction and maintenance of the system, and public health. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), depth to a water table, ponding, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, and flooding affect absorption of the effluent. Stones and boulders, ice, and bedrock or a cemented pan interfere with installation. Subsidence interferes with installation and maintenance. Excessive slope may cause lateral seepage and surfacing of the effluent in downslope areas.

Some soils are underlain by loose sand and gravel or fractured bedrock at a depth of less than 4 feet below the distribution lines. In these soils the absorption field may not adequately filter the effluent, particularly when the system is new. As a result, the ground water may become contaminated.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect the specified use.

526,Soil-Based Residential Wastewater Disposal Ratings (VT),mapunit,vtsepticsyscl,Choice,254,NA,"This interpretation indicates the suitability of the soils for soil-based residential wastewater disposal systems. The ratings are based on the 2007 Vermont Environmental Protection Rules (Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation, Agency of Natural Resources). This rating system replaces the system in the publication ""Ancillary Soil Interpretation Ratings for On-site Sewage Disposal in Vermont,"" published in January 1997 by the Natural Resources Conservation Service.

Included in soil-based wastewater disposal systems are absorption fields, also known as leach fields, or trenches in which effluent from a septic tank is distributed into the soil through subsurface tiles or perforated pipe. There must be unsaturated soil material beneath the absorption field to filter the effluent effectively. Unsatisfactory performance, including excessively slow absorption of effluent, surfacing of effluent, and hillside seepage, can affect public health.

The ratings are represented by symbols for five interpretive groups and their subgroups. These groups and subgroups are described in the following paragraphs.

Group I soils are well suited to soil-based wastewater disposal systems. Good performance and low maintenance can be expected. The soils in this group are sandy and gravelly soils that formed in outwash and that have rapid permeability in the substratum and well drained soils that formed in till and that have a friable substratum with moderate permeability. Slopes generally are less than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup Ia have rapid permeability and slopes of less than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup Ib have rapid permeability and slopes that range to more than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup Ic have moderate permeability and slopes of less than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup Id have moderate permeability and slopes that range to more than 20 percent.

Group II soils are moderately suited to soil-based wastewater disposal systems. This group includes soils with moderately slow to very slow permeability; complexes in which one or more of the soils have bedrock at a moderate depth (20 to 40 inches); soils that would qualify for inclusion in group I but have slopes of more than 20 percent; and soils that have a seasonal high water table at a depth of 18 inches or more.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIa have moderately slow to very slow permeability and slopes of less than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIb have moderately slow to very slow permeability and have slopes that range to more than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIc have bedrock at a moderate depth (20 to 40 inches) in some areas and have slopes of less than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IId have bedrock at a moderate depth (20 to 40 inches) and have slopes that range to more than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIe have rapid permeability and have slopes of more than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIf have moderate permeability and slopes of more than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIh have a seasonal high water table at a depth of 18 inches or more and have slopes of less than 20 percent.

Group III map units are marginally suited to soil-based wastewater disposal systems. Intensive onsite investigation may be needed to locate suitable areas, or special design, extra maintenance, or costly alteration may be needed to overcome the soil-related limitations. In areas where the water table is at a shallow depth, seasonal onsite monitoring of the water table may be needed to determine whether the site is suitable. Some areas of any of the map units in group III may not be suitable for soil-based wastewater disposal systems.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIIa have bedrock at a depth of less than 10 inches in some areas. Some map units are limited by slopes that range to more than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIIb are subject to flooding and have a seasonal high water table at a moderate depth.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIIc have a seasonal high water table at a depth of 1 foot or less and have slopes of 8 percent or less.
     •   	Map units in subgroup IIId have a seasonal high water table at a depth of 1 foot or less and have slopes of 8 to 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIIe generally have a seasonal high water table within a depth of 2 feet and have slopes that range to more than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIIf have a seasonal high water table and limited depth to bedrock. Some map units have slopes that range to more than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IIIg have a flooding hazard.

Group IV map units are generally not suited to soil-based wastewater disposal systems because of such limitations as wetness, depth to bedrock, restricted permeability, and slope.
     •	Map units in subgroup IVa are subject to excessive wetness.
     •	Map units in subgroup IVb are limited by the depth to bedrock and by slopes of more than 20 percent.
     •	Map units in subgroup IVc are generally not suited because of a very limited depth to bedrock and the slope.
     •	Map units in subgroup IVd have moderately slow to very slow permeability and have slopes of more than 20 percent. Some map units have a seasonal high water table.

Group V map units are not rated for soil-based wastewater disposal systems. This group includes miscellaneous areas that have been filled, excavated, regraded, or otherwise disturbed by human activities; areas that are mapped above the series level, such as Udorthents; and areas of water. The miscellaneous areas and the areas mapped above the series level have a wide range of soil properties. Onsite investigation is needed to determine the suitability of these areas for soil-based wastewater disposal.

These ratings are based on the installation of a new septic system for a new single-family home on a lot subdivided on or after June 14, 2002, in a municipality that has planning and zoning bylaws. The ratings do not necessarily apply to the siting of a replacement system for an existing residence. The ratings for lots subdivided before June 14, 2002, are based on a slope limitation of 30 percent, whereas the ratings in this interpretation are based on a slope limitation of 20 percent.

Considered in the ratings are flooding, ponding, depth to a water table, content of lime, reaction, available water capacity, soil moisture regime, soil temperature regime, aspect, and slope. 

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. The soils are described as having a ""low,"" ""moderate,"" or ""high"" potential for seedling mortality. ""Low"" indicates that seedling mortality is unlikely. Good performance can be expected, and little or no maintenance is needed. ""Moderate"" indicates that seedling mortality can occur because one or more soil properties are less than desirable. Fair performance can be expected, and some maintenance is needed. ""High"" indicates that seedling mortality can occur because of one or more soil properties and that overcoming the unfavorable properties requires special design, extra maintenance, and costly alteration.

Numerical ratings indicate gradations between the point at which the potential for seedling mortality is highest (1.00) and the point at which the potential is lowest (0.00).

Ratings are based on the ease of setting posts in the soil, the ease of maintaining the wire tension, and the estimated replacement and maintenance costs. Excavations for wooden posts are made by power augers or are hand dug. Metal posts are driven into the soil.
 
Depth to bedrock or a cemented pan and the content of large and small stones influence the excavation of postholes and the driving of posts. Flooding and the depth to a seasonal high water table may restrict the season of construction. Flooding also increases maintenance and replacement costs. High water tables increase maintenance costs and require deeper post settings.

Setting the posts in permanently frozen soil may result in loss of the insulation qualities of the soil and in thermokarst topography. In areas of sandy soils, aligning the posts and maintaining the desired wire tension commonly are difficult because of low soil strength. Soil blowing causes maintenance problems. Frost action results in frost heaving of the posts. Steep slopes restrict the use of power augers and the delivery of supplies.

78,Disposal of Wastewater by Irrigation,cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"Wastewater includes municipal and food-processing wastewater and effluent from lagoons or storage ponds. Municipal wastewater is the waste stream from a municipality. It contains domestic waste and may contain industrial waste. It may have received primary or secondary treatment. It is rarely untreated sewage. Food-processing wastewater results from the preparation of fruits, vegetables, milk, cheese, and meats for public consumption. In places it is high in content of sodium and chloride. The effluent in lagoons and storage ponds is from facilities used to treat or store food-processing wastewater or domestic or animal waste. Domestic and food-processing wastewater is very dilute, and the effluent from the facilities that treat or store it commonly is very low in content of carbonaceous and nitrogenous material; the content of nitrogen commonly ranges from 10 to 30 milligrams per liter. The wastewater from animal waste treatment lagoons or storage ponds, however, has much higher concentrations of these materials, mainly because the manure has not been diluted as much as the domestic waste. The content of nitrogen in this wastewater generally ranges from 50 to 2,000 milligrams per liter. When wastewater is applied, checks should be made to ensure that nitrogen, heavy metals, and salts are not added in excessive amounts.

Disposal of wastewater by irrigation not only disposes of municipal wastewater and wastewater from food-processing plants, lagoons, and storage ponds but also can improve crop production by increasing the amount of water available to crops. The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect the design, construction, management, and performance of the irrigation system. The properties that affect design and management include the sodium adsorption ratio, depth to a water table, ponding, available water capacity, saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), slope, and flooding. The properties that affect construction include stones, cobbles, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, depth to a water table, and ponding. The properties that affect performance include depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, bulk density, the sodium adsorption ratio, salinity, reaction, and the cation-exchange capacity, which is used to estimate the capacity of a soil to adsorb heavy metals. Permanently frozen soils are not suitable for disposal of wastewater by irrigation.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect agricultural waste management. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected. ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use.

57,Disposal of Wastewater by Rapid Infiltration,cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"Rapid infiltration of wastewater is a process in which wastewater applied in a level basin at a rate of 4 to 120 inches per week percolates through the soil. The wastewater may eventually reach the ground water. The application rate commonly exceeds the rate needed for irrigation of cropland. Vegetation is not a necessary part of the treatment; thus, the basins may or may not be vegetated. The thickness of the soil material needed for proper treatment of the wastewater is more than 72 inches. As a result, geologic and hydrologic investigation is needed to ensure proper design and performance and to determine the risk of ground-water pollution.

Soil properties are important considerations in areas where soils are used as sites for the treatment and disposal of organic waste and wastewater. Selection of soils with properties that favor waste management can help to prevent environmental damage.

Municipal wastewater is the waste stream from a municipality. It contains domestic waste and may contain industrial waste. It may have received primary or secondary treatment. It is rarely untreated sewage. Food-processing wastewater results from the preparation of fruits, vegetables, milk, cheese, and meats for public consumption. In places it is high in content of sodium and chloride. The effluent in lagoons and storage ponds is from facilities used to treat or store food-processing wastewater or domestic or animal waste. Domestic and food-processing wastewater is very dilute, and the effluent from the facilities that treat or store it commonly is very low in content of carbonaceous and nitrogenous material; the content of nitrogen commonly ranges from 10 to 30 milligrams per liter. The wastewater from animal waste treatment lagoons or storage ponds, however, has much higher concentrations of these materials, mainly because the manure has not been diluted as much as the domestic waste. The content of nitrogen in this wastewater generally ranges from 50 to 2,000 milligrams per liter. When wastewater is applied, checks should be made to ensure that nitrogen, heavy metals, and salts are not added in excessive amounts.

The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect the risk of pollution and the design, construction, and performance of the system. Depth to a water table, ponding, flooding, and depth to bedrock or a cemented pan affect the risk of pollution and the design and construction of the system. Slope, stones, and cobbles also affect design and construction. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) and reaction affect performance. Permanently frozen soils are unsuitable for waste treatment.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect agricultural waste management. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected. ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation. Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected. ""Very limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for the specified use. The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive installation procedures. Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected.

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (0.00).

64,Overland Flow Treatment of Wastewater,cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"In this process wastewater is applied to the upper reaches of sloped land and allowed to flow across vegetated surfaces, sometimes called terraces, to runoff-collection ditches. The length of the run generally is 150 to 300 feet. The application rate ranges from 2.5 to 16.0 inches per week. It commonly exceeds the rate needed for irrigation of cropland. The wastewater leaves solids and nutrients on the vegetated surfaces as it flows downslope in a thin film. Most of the water reaches the collection ditch, some is lost through evapotranspiration, and a small amount may percolate to the ground water.

29,Manure and Food-Processing Waste,cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"The application of manure and food-processing waste not only disposes of waste material but also can improve crop production by increasing the supply of nutrients in the soils where the material is applied. Manure is the excrement of livestock and poultry, and food-processing waste is damaged fruit and vegetables and the peelings, stems, leaves, pits, and soil particles removed in food preparation. The manure and food-processing waste are solid, slurry, or liquid. Their nitrogen content varies. A high content of nitrogen limits the application rate. Toxic or otherwise dangerous wastes, such as those mixed with the lye used in food processing, are not considered in the ratings.

The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect absorption, plant growth, microbial activity, erodibility, the rate at which the waste is applied, and the method by which the waste is applied. The properties that affect absorption include saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), depth to a water table, ponding, the sodium adsorption ratio, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, and available water capacity. The properties that affect plant growth and microbial activity include reaction, the sodium adsorption ratio, salinity, and bulk density. The wind erodibility group, soil erosion factor K, and slope are considered in estimating the likelihood that wind erosion or water erosion will transport the waste material from the application site. Stones, cobbles, a water table, ponding, and flooding can hinder the application of waste. Permanently frozen soils are unsuitable for waste treatment.

They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (0.00).

Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by the soil features that affect the soil interpretation.  Verbal soil rating classes are based on the highest numerical rating for the most limiting soil feature(s) considered in the rating process.  ""Not limited"" (numerical value for the most restrictive feature = 0.00) indicates that the soil has no limiting features for the specified use.  ""Somewhat limited"" (numerical value for the most restrictive feature =.01 to .99) indicates that the soil has limiting features for the specified use that can be overcome with proper planning, design, installation, and management.  The effort required to overcome a soil limitation increases as the numerical rating increases.  ""Very limited"" (numerical value for the most restrictive feature = 1.00) indicates that the soil has one or more very limiting features that can only be overcome with special planning, major soil modification, special design, or significant management practices.

Lesser soil restrictive features have a lower numerical value than the maximum used to rate the soil, and they are identified to provide the user with additional information about soil limitations for the specific use.  Lesser soil restrictive features also need to be considered in planning, design, installation, and management.

392,"Irrigation, Surface (Level)",cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"This interpretation evaluates a soil's limitation(s) for basin, paddy, level furrow, or level border irrigation systems.  The ratings are for soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use.

Level surface irrigation systems use flood irrigation techniques to spread irrigation water at a specified depth across the application area.  Basin, paddy, and borders generally use external ridges or borders to confine the water, while level furrow systems use furrow valleys and end blocks or border ridges to confine the water during irrigation.  With furrow irrigation the crop is usually planted on the furrow ridge.  Generally, basin, paddy and level border irrigation systems are suitable for rice, small grain, pasture, and forage production.  Level furrow systems are generally suited for row crops. 

The soil properties and qualities important in the design and management of level surface irrigation systems are depth, available water holding capacity, sodium adsorption ratio, saturated hydraulic conductivity, salinity, slope, and flooding.  The soil properties and qualities that influence installation are depth, flooding, and ponding.  The features that affect performance of the system and plant growth are salinity, sodium adsorption ratio, and available water holding capacity.

471,Soil Taxonomy Classification,component,taxclname,String,120,NA,"This rating presents the taxonomic classification based on Soil Taxonomy.

The system of soil classification used by the National Cooperative Soil Survey has six categories (Soil Survey Staff, 1999 and 2003). Beginning with the broadest, these categories are the order, suborder, great group, subgroup, family, and series. Classification is based on soil properties observed in the field or inferred from those observations or from laboratory measurements. This table shows the classification of the soils in the survey area. The categories are defined in the following paragraphs.

ORDER. Twelve soil orders are recognized. The differences among orders reflect the dominant soil-forming processes and the degree of soil formation. Each order is identified by a word ending in sol. An example is Alfisols.

SUBORDER. Each order is divided into suborders primarily on the basis of properties that influence soil genesis and are important to plant growth or properties that reflect the most important variables within the orders. The last syllable in the name of a suborder indicates the order. An example is Udalfs (Ud, meaning humid, plus alfs, from Alfisols).

GREAT GROUP. Each suborder is divided into great groups on the basis of close similarities in kind, arrangement, and degree of development of pedogenic horizons; soil moisture and temperature regimes; type of saturation; and base status. Each great group is identified by the name of a suborder and by a prefix that indicates a property of the soil. An example is Hapludalfs (Hapl, meaning minimal horizonation, plus udalfs, the suborder of the Alfisols that has a udic moisture regime).

SUBGROUP. Each great group has a typic subgroup. Other subgroups are intergrades or extragrades. The typic subgroup is the central concept of the great group; it is not necessarily the most extensive. Intergrades are transitions to other orders, suborders, or great groups. Extragrades have some properties that are not representative of the great group but do not indicate transitions to any other taxonomic class. Each subgroup is identified by one or more adjectives preceding the name of the great group. The adjective Typic identifies the subgroup that typifies the great group. An example is Typic Hapludalfs.

FAMILY. Families are established within a subgroup on the basis of physical and chemical properties and other characteristics that affect management. Generally, the properties are those of horizons below plow depth where there is much biological activity. Among the properties and characteristics considered are particle-size class, mineralogy class, cation-exchange activity class, soil temperature regime, soil depth, and reaction class. A family name consists of the name of a subgroup preceded by terms that indicate soil properties. An example is fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Typic Hapludalfs.

SERIES. The series consists of soils within a family that have horizons similar in color, texture, structure, reaction, consistence, mineral and chemical composition, and arrangement in the profile.

74,Nonirrigated Capability Class,component,nirrcapcl,Choice,254,NA,"Land capability classification shows, in a general way, the suitability of soils for most kinds of field crops. Crops that require special management are excluded. The soils are grouped according to their limitations for field crops, the risk of damage if they are used for crops, and the way they respond to management. The criteria used in grouping the soils do not include major and generally expensive landforming that would change slope, depth, or other characteristics of the soils, nor do they include possible but unlikely major reclamation projects. Capability classification is not a substitute for interpretations that show suitability and limitations of groups of soils for rangeland, for woodland, or for engineering purposes.

In the capability system, soils are generally grouped at three levels-capability class, subclass, and unit. Only class and subclass are included in this data set.

Capability classes, the broadest groups, are designated by the numbers 1 through 8. The numbers indicate progressively greater limitations and narrower choices for practical use. The classes are defined as follows:

Class 1 soils have few limitations that restrict their use.

Class 2 soils have moderate limitations that reduce the choice of plants or that require moderate conservation practices.

Class 3 soils have severe limitations that reduce the choice of plants or that require special conservation practices, or both.

Class 4 soils have very severe limitations that reduce the choice of plants or that require very careful management, or both.

Class 5 soils are subject to little or no erosion but have other limitations, impractical to remove, that restrict their use mainly to pasture, rangeland, forestland, or wildlife habitat.

Class 6 soils have severe limitations that make them generally unsuitable for cultivation and that restrict their use mainly to pasture, rangeland, forestland, or wildlife habitat.

Class 7 soils have very severe limitations that make them unsuitable for cultivation and that restrict their use mainly to grazing, forestland, or wildlife habitat.

Class 8 soils and miscellaneous areas have limitations that preclude commercial plant production and that restrict their use to recreational purposes, wildlife habitat, watershed, or esthetic purposes.",,,Property,,NA,,0,1,0,0,capability_class,1,,,1,NirrCpCls,,,,,,,,0,,NA,NA,,0,,,Weighted Average,0,0,,1,7,NA,"<Map_Legend maplegendkey=""7""><ColorRampType type=""1"" name=""Progressive"" count=""3""><LowerColor part=""0"" algorithm=""1"" red=""255"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /><UpperColor part=""0"" algorithm=""1"" red=""255"" green=""255"" blue=""0"" /><LowerColor part=""1"" algorithm=""1"" red=""255"" green=""255"" blue=""0"" /><UpperColor part=""1"" algorithm=""1"" red=""0"" green=""255"" blue=""255"" /><LowerColor part=""2"" algorithm=""1"" red=""0"" green=""255"" blue=""255"" /><UpperColor part=""2"" algorithm=""1"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""255"" /></ColorRampType><Legend_Symbols shapeType=""polygon""><Styles fillStyle=""esriSFSSolid"" /><Font type=""Times New Roman"" size=""8"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /><Line type=""outline"" width=""0.4"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /></Legend_Symbols><Legend_Elements transparency=""0""><Labels value=""1"" label=""Capability Class - I"" order=""1"" /><Labels value=""2"" label=""Capability Class - II"" order=""2"" /><Labels value=""3"" label=""Capability Class - III"" order=""3"" /><Labels value=""4"" label=""Capability Class - IV"" order=""4"" /><Labels value=""5"" label=""Capability Class - V"" order=""5"" /><Labels value=""6"" label=""Capability Class - VI"" order=""6"" /><Labels value=""7"" label=""Capability Class - VII"" order=""7"" /><Labels value=""8"" label=""Capability Class - VIII"" order=""8"" /></Legend_Elements></Map_Legend>",1,03/04/2007 08:37:51,Dominant Condition,NA,1,Choice

Capability classification is not a substitute for interpretations that show suitability and limitations of groups of soils for rangeland, for woodland, or for engineering purposes.

In the capability system, soils are generally grouped at three levels-capability class, subclass, and unit. Only class and subclass are included in this data set.

Capability subclasses are soil groups within one capability class. They are designated by adding a small letter, ""e,"" ""w,"" ""s,"" or ""c,"" to the class numeral, for example, 2e. The letter ""e"" shows that the main hazard is the risk of erosion unless close-growing plant cover is maintained; ""w"" shows that water in or on the soil interferes with plant growth or cultivation (in some soils the wetness can be partly corrected by artificial drainage); ""s"" shows that the soil is limited mainly because it is shallow, droughty, or stony; and ""c,"" used in only some parts of the United States, shows that the chief limitation is climate that is very cold or very dry.

In class 1 there are no subclasses because the soils of this class have few limitations. Class 5 contains only the subclasses indicated by ""w,"" ""s,"" or ""c"" because the soils in class 5 are subject to little or no erosion.

Capability classes, the broadest groups, are designated by the numbers 1 through 8. The numbers indicate progressively greater limitations and narrower choices for practical use. The classes are defined as follows:

Class 1 soils have few limitations that restrict their use.

Class 2 soils have moderate limitations that reduce the choice of plants or that require moderate conservation practices.

Class 3 soils have severe limitations that reduce the choice of plants or that require special conservation practices, or both.

Class 4 soils have very severe limitations that reduce the choice of plants or that require very careful management, or both.

Class 5 soils are subject to little or no erosion but have other limitations, impractical to remove, that restrict their use mainly to pasture, rangeland, forestland, or wildlife habitat.

For example, ""Loamy Upland"" is the name of a rangeland ecological site. An ""ecological site"" is the product of all the environmental factors responsible for its development. It has characteristic soils that have developed over time; a characteristic hydrology, particularly infiltration and runoff, that has developed over time; and a characteristic plant community (kind and amount of vegetation). The vegetation, soils, and hydrology are all interrelated. Each is influenced by the others and influences the development of the others. For example, the hydrology of the site is influenced by development of the soil and plant community. The plant community on an ecological site is typified by an association of species that differs from that of other ecological sites in the kind and/or proportion of species or in total production. Descriptions of ecological sites are provided in the Field Office Technical Guide, which is available in local offices of the Natural Resources Conservation Service.

191,Conservation Tree and Shrub Group,component,constreeshrubgrp,Choice,254,NA,"Each tree and shrub species has certain climatic and physiographic limits. Within these parameters, trees and shrubs may be well suited or poorly suited to a given environment because of climate or site or soil characteristics. On the basis of the performance of individual species to specific conditions of soil, climate, physiography, and management, Conservation Tree and Shrub Groups (CTSGs) have been developed. Individual soils have been grouped with similar soils into one of the 10 main CTSGs. Most of these main groups are further divided into subgroups.

This interpretation provides guidance in selecting the species best suited to each of the groups of soils within each vegetative zone. It also can be used for predicting survival, height, growth, species attributes, and effectiveness and for selecting species for windbreaks, riparian plantings, recreation and wildlife plantings, and ornamental or environmental plantings.

Tree and shrub species associated with each CTSG are broken down by vegetative zones (rainfall zones). These lists are available in the local office of the USDA, Natural Resources Conservation Service, or on the Web in the electronic Field Office Technical Guide. Because vegetative zones are rather large, climatic differences within a zone should be considered when species are recommended for planting. For example, some species adapted to the eastern end of a zone may be inadequately adapted to the western end. Care must be taken to ensure that conditions on individual sites are considered when species suitability and performance are determined. A case-by-case decision may be necessary to determine which CTSG is most appropriate when an individual site has characteristics that differ from those of the CTSG in which it occurs. These differences occur because of inclusions of other soils, site modifications (such as leveling and drainage manipulation), soil pH (calcareous sites), irrigation, soil amendments, or other factors.",,,Property,,NA,,0,1,0,0,,0,,,-1,ConsTSG,,,,,,,,0,,NA,NA,,0,,,Weighted Average,0,0,,1,7,NA,"<Map_Legend maplegendkey=""7"">

523,NH Forest Soil Group,mapunit,nhiforsoigrp,Choice,254,NA,"NH Forest Soil Groups (NHFSGs) consist of map units that are similar in their potential for commercial forest products, their suitability for native tree growth, and their use and management. Considered in grouping the map units are depth to bedrock, texture, saturated hydraulic conductivity, available water capacity, drainage class, and slope. The grouping applies only to soils in the State of New Hampshire.

The NHFSGs have been developed to help land users and managers in New Hampshire evaluate the relative productivity of soils and to better understand patterns of plant succession and how soil and site interactions influence management decisions. The soils are assigned to one of five groups (IA, IB, IC, IIA, and IIB). Several map units in New Hampshire either vary so greatly or have such a limited potential for commercial forest products that they have not been assigned to an NHFSG (NC). Examples of NC map units are very poorly drained soils and soils at high elevations. The kinds of tree species generally growing in climax stands in each of the five NHFSGs vary from county to county. This information is available through local NRCS field offices. 


IA--This group consists of very deep, loamy, moderately well drained or well drained soils. Generally, these soils are more fertile than other soils and have the most favorable soil moisture relationships. 

IB--The soils in this group are generally sandy or loamy over sandy material and are slightly less fertile than group IA soils.  Group IB soils are moderately well drained or well drained. Their soil moisture is adequate for good tree growth, but it may not be quite as abundant as that in group IA soils. 

IC--The soils in this group are in areas of outwash sand and gravel. They are moderately well to excessively drained. Their soil moisture is adequate for good softwood growth but is limited for hardwoods. 

IIA--This diverse group includes many of the same soils as those in groups IA and IB. The soils are separated into a unique group, however, because they have physical limitations that make forest management more difficult and costly, i.e., steep slopes, bedrock outcrops, erosive textures, surface boulders, and extreme rockiness. 

IIB--The soils in this group are poorly drained. The seasonal high water table is generally within 12 inches of the surface. Productivity is generally less than that of soils in the other groups. 

NC--The map units in this category either vary so greatly or have such a limited potential for commercial forest products that they have not been assigned to an NHFSG.

Each map unit is rated based on its respective components and the percentage of each component within the map unit. 

The thematic map is color coded based on the composition of hydric components. The five color classes are separated as 100 percent hydric components, 66 to 99 percent hydric components, 33 to 65 percent hydric components, 1 to 32 percent hydric components, and less than one percent hydric components.

In Web Soil Survey, the Summary by Map Unit table that is displayed below the map pane contains a column named 'Rating'.  In this column the percentage of each map unit that is classified as hydric is displayed.

Hydric soils are defined by the National Technical Committee for Hydric Soils (NTCHS) as soils that formed under conditions of saturation, flooding, or ponding long enough during the growing season to develop anaerobic conditions in the upper part (Federal Register, 1994). Under natural conditions, these soils are either saturated or inundated long enough during the growing season to support the growth and reproduction of hydrophytic vegetation. 

The NTCHS definition identifies general soil properties that are associated with wetness. In order to determine whether a specific soil is a hydric soil or nonhydric soil, however, more specific information, such as information about the depth and duration of the water table, is needed. Thus, criteria that identify those estimated soil properties unique to hydric soils have been established (Federal Register, 2002). These criteria are used to identify map unit components that normally are associated with wetlands. The criteria used are selected estimated soil properties that are described in ""Soil Taxonomy"" (Soil Survey Staff, 1999) and ""Keys to Soil Taxonomy"" (Soil Survey Staff, 2006) and in the ""Soil Survey Manual"" (Soil Survey Division Staff, 1993). 

If soils are wet enough for a long enough period of time to be considered hydric, they should exhibit certain properties that can be easily observed in the field. These visible properties are indicators of hydric soils. The indicators used to make onsite determinations of hydric soils are specified in ""Field Indicators of Hydric Soils in the United States"" (Hurt and Vasilas, 2006).

2685,National Commodity Crop Productivity Index v3,cointerp,interphrc,String,254,3,"National Commodity Crop Productivity Index is a method of arraying the soils of the United States for non-irrigated commodity crop production based on their inherent soil properties.  The rating a soil is assigned is the highest one of four basic crop group indices, which are based on the climate where the crop is typically grown.  Cooler climates are represented by winter wheat, moderate climates are represented by corn and soybeans, and warmer climates are represented by cotton.  (http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/nrcs142p2_050734.pdf)

The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas. Ratings are for soils in their present condition. The present land use is not considered in the ratings. 

Ratings are based on properties and qualities to the depth normally observed during soil mapping (approximately 6 feet).  Soil, site, and climate properties that influence the growth of crops are major considerations. Soil productivity is influenced by many soil properties.  An ideal soil will store adequate amounts of water to nurture the crop between rains.  This soil will have a near-neutral pH, will store nutrients, and lack toxic materials.  The soil will have no barriers, either physical or chemical, to root growth.  Water and gas transmission through the soil will be sufficient to maintain both water and oxygen at sufficient levels in the root zone.   The soil will not be saturated with water during the growing season to the point that root growth is inhibited.  The soil will not be subject to excessive flooding or ponding during the growing season.  Slope is an important consideration because it affects erosion by water, runoff, and the operation of equipment.  The climate must provide adequate water and heat to allow the desired crop to mature.  A soil that differs from the ideal in any of these features will have lower inherent productivity for a particular crop.  The further a soil differs from ideality in any one or all of the factors that determine inherent productivity, the lower its inherent productivity will be. 

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the estimated productivity which is determined by all of the soil, site, and climatic features that affect crop productivity. ""High inherent productivity"" indicates that the soil, site, and climate have features that are very favorable for crop production. High yields and low risk of crop failure can be expected if a high level of management is employed. ""Moderately high inherent productivity"" indicates that the soil has features that are generally quite favorable for crop production.  Good yields and moderately low risk of crop failure can be expected. ""Moderate inherent productivity"" indicates that the soil has features that are generally favorable for crop production.  Good yields and moderate risk of crop failure can be expected.  ""Moderately low inherent productivity"" indicates that the soil has features that are generally not favorable for crop production.  Low yields and moderately high risk of crop failure can be expected.   ""Low inherent productivity"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for crop production.  Low yields and high risk of crop failure can be expected.  

Numerical ratings indicate the overall productivity of the soil. The ratings are shown in decimal fractions ranging from 1.00 to 0.01. They indicate gradations between the point at which the combination of soil, site, and climate features has the greatest positive impact on inherent productivity (1.00) and the point at which the soil features are very unfavorable (0.01). 

The map unit components listed for each map unit in the accompanying Summary by Map Unit table in Web Soil Survey or the Aggregation Report in Soil Data Viewer are determined by the aggregation method chosen. An aggregated rating class is shown for each map unit. The components listed for each map unit are only those that have the same rating class as listed for the map unit. The percent composition of each component in a particular map unit is presented to help the user better understand the percentage of each map unit that has the rating presented.

61,"Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity (Ksat), Standard Classes",chorizon,ksat_r,Float,NA,4,"Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) refers to the ease with which pores in a saturated soil transmit water. The estimates are expressed in terms of micrometers per second. They are based on soil characteristics observed in the field, particularly structure, porosity, and texture. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is considered in the design of soil drainage systems and septic tank absorption fields. 

For each soil layer, this attribute is actually recorded as three separate values in the database. A low value and a high value indicate the range of this attribute for the soil component. A ""representative"" value indicates the expected value of this attribute for the component. For this soil property, only the representative value is used.

Soils are assigned to one of four groups according to the rate of water infiltration when the soils are not protected by vegetation, are thoroughly wet, and receive precipitation from long-duration storms.

The soils in the United States are assigned to four groups (A, B, C, and D) and three dual classes (A/D, B/D, and C/D). The groups are defined as follows:

Group A. Soils having a high infiltration rate (low runoff potential) when thoroughly wet. These consist mainly of deep, well drained to excessively drained sands or gravelly sands. These soils have a high rate of water transmission.

Group B. Soils having a moderate infiltration rate when thoroughly wet. These consist chiefly of moderately deep or deep, moderately well drained or well drained soils that have moderately fine texture to moderately coarse texture. These soils have a moderate rate of water transmission.

Group C. Soils having a slow infiltration rate when thoroughly wet. These consist chiefly of soils having a layer that impedes the downward movement of water or soils of moderately fine texture or fine texture. These soils have a slow rate of water transmission.

Group D. Soils having a very slow infiltration rate (high runoff potential) when thoroughly wet. These consist chiefly of clays that have a high shrink-swell potential, soils that have a high water table, soils that have a claypan or clay layer at or near the surface, and soils that are shallow over nearly impervious material. These soils have a very slow rate of water transmission.

113,"Vehicle Trafficability, Type 1, Dry Season",cointerp,interphrc,string,254,NA,"Military category type 1 vehicles are lightweight and have low contact pressure (less than 2.0 pounds per square inch). For this interpretation, trafficability is the capacity of the soil to support these vehicles during dry periods. Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data, such as topography data, and from data about soil and weather conditions. Military trafficability interpretations are based on procedures and criteria described in the Army Field Manual 5-430-00-1, chapter 7, and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning. Commanders and engineers must be cautious because the interpreted results can vary greatly.

Assessing the trafficability of fine grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine grained material to behave like fine grained soils is more difficult than assessing the trafficability of coarse grained soils (clean sands). Soil-vehicle interactions involving soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large stones on the surface, and slope are the basis for trafficability interpretations.

The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or manmade obstacles (such as forests or ditches) or with vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning). The interpretation is developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subject to freeze-thaw cycles if they are not frozen at the time of vehicle use.

Trafficability performance was estimated for a minimum number of vehicle passes (one) or a maximum of 50 vehicles in the same ruts. Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and the Unified soil classification are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability. For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, should remain firm under repeated traffic, and should not be dusty when dry. Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are the Unified soil classification and its relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness. 

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating classes of ""excellent,"" ""good,"" ""fair,"" and ""poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic. ""Excellent"" indicates that the soil has no characteristics that limit trafficability and that very low maintenance can be expected. ""Good"" indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use. Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management. ""Fair"" indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management. Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected. ""Poor"" indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use. Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management. Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (0.01) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (1.00).

116,"Vehicle Trafficability, Type 2, Dry Season",cointerp,interphrc,string,254,NA,"Military category type 2 vehicles are engineer and high-speed tractors with comparatively wide tracks and low contact pressures. For this interpretation, trafficability is the capacity of the soil to support these vehicles during dry periods. Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data, such as topography data, and from data about soil and weather conditions. Military trafficability interpretations are based on procedures and criteria described in the Army Field Manual 5-430-00-1, chapter 7, and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning. Commanders and engineers must be cautious because the interpreted results can vary greatly.

Assessing the trafficability of fine grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine grained material to behave like fine grained soils is more difficult than assessing the trafficability of coarse grained soils (clean sands). Soil-vehicle interactions involving soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large stones on the surface, and slope are the basis for trafficability interpretations.

The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or manmade obstacles (such as forests or ditches) or with vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning). The interpretation is developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subject to freeze-thaw cycles if they are not frozen at the time of vehicle use.

Trafficability performance was estimated for a minimum number of vehicle passes (one) or a maximum of 50 vehicles in the same ruts. Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and the Unified soil classification are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability. For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, should remain firm under repeated traffic, and should not be dusty when dry. Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are the Unified soil classification and its relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness. 

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating classes of ""excellent,"" ""good,"" ""fair,"" and ""poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic. ""Excellent"" indicates that the soil has no characteristics that limit trafficability and that very low maintenance can be expected.

122,"Vehicle Trafficability, Type 4, Dry Season",cointerp,interphrc,string,254,NA,"Military category type 4 vehicles are most medium tanks, tractors with high contact pressures, and all-wheel-drive trucks and trailed vehicles with low contact pressures. For this interpretation, trafficability is the capacity of the soil to support these vehicles during dry periods. Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data, such as topography data, and from data about soil and weather conditions. Military trafficability interpretations are based on procedures and criteria described in the Army Field Manual 5-430-00-1, chapter 7, and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning. Commanders and engineers must be cautious because the interpreted results can vary greatly.

Assessing the trafficability of fine grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine grained material to behave like fine grained soils is more difficult than assessing the trafficability of coarse grained soils (clean sands). Soil-vehicle interactions involving soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large stones on the surface, and slope are the basis for trafficability interpretations.

The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or manmade obstacles (such as forests or ditches) or with vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning). The interpretation is developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subject to freeze-thaw cycles if they are not frozen at the time of vehicle use.

Trafficability performance was estimated for a minimum number of vehicle passes (one) or a maximum of 50 vehicles in the same ruts. Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and the Unified soil classification are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability. For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, should remain firm under repeated traffic, and should not be dusty when dry. Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are the Unified soil classification and its relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness. 

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating classes of ""excellent,"" ""good,"" ""fair,"" and ""poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic. ""Excellent"" indicates that the soil has no characteristics that limit trafficability and that very low maintenance can be expected. ""Good"" indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use. Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management. ""Fair"" indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management. Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected. ""Poor"" indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use. Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management. Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

128,"Vehicle Trafficability, Type 6, Dry Season",cointerp,interphrc,string,254,NA,"Military category type 6 vehicles are a great number of all-wheel-drive and rear-wheel-drive trucks and trailed vehicles intended primarily for highway use. For this interpretation, trafficability is the capacity of the soil to support these vehicles during dry periods. Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data, such as topography data, and from data about soil and weather conditions. Military trafficability interpretations are based on procedures and criteria described in the Army Field Manual 5-430-00-1, chapter 7, and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning. Commanders and engineers must be cautious because the interpreted results can vary greatly.

Assessing the trafficability of fine grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine grained material to behave like fine grained soils is more difficult than assessing the trafficability of coarse grained soils (clean sands). Soil-vehicle interactions involving soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large stones on the surface, and slope are the basis for trafficability interpretations.

The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or manmade obstacles (such as forests or ditches) or with vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning). The interpretation is developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subject to freeze-thaw cycles if they are not frozen at the time of vehicle use.

Trafficability performance was estimated for a minimum number of vehicle passes (one) or a maximum of 50 vehicles in the same ruts. Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and the Unified soil classification are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability. For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, should remain firm under repeated traffic, and should not be dusty when dry. Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are the Unified soil classification and its relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness. 

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating classes of ""excellent,"" ""good,"" ""fair,"" and ""poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic. ""Excellent"" indicates that the soil has no characteristics that limit trafficability and that very low maintenance can be expected. ""Good"" indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use. Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management. ""Fair"" indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management. Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected. ""Poor"" indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use. Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management. Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (0.01) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (1.00).

It does not include problems associated with natural or manmade obstacles (such as forests or ditches) or with vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning). The interpretation is developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subject to freeze-thaw cycles if they are not frozen at the time of vehicle use.

Trafficability performance was estimated for a maximum of 50 vehicle passes in the same ruts. Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and the Unified soil classification are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability. For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, should remain firm under repeated traffic, and should not be dusty when dry. Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are the Unified soil classification and its relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating classes of ""excellent,"" ""good,"" ""fair,"" and ""poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic. ""Excellent"" indicates that the soil has no characteristics that limit trafficability and that very low maintenance can be expected. ""Good"" indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use. Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management. ""Fair"" indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management. Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected. ""Poor"" indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use. Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management. Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (0.01) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (1.00).

106,Bivouac Areas,cointerp,interphrc,string,254,NA,"Bivouac areas are used intensively as field operation centers for military activity. They commonly require site preparation, such as shaping and leveling in areas used for tents and in parking areas, stabilizing roads and intensively used areas, and installing sanitary facilities and utility lines. Bivouac areas are subject to heavy foot traffic and some vehicular traffic.

This interpretation identifies those soil properties that influence the ease of developing bivouac areas and the performance of the areas after development. Soil properties that influence trafficability and promote the growth of vegetation after heavy use also are important. The limitations are less restrictive on sites for tents or remote camps.

Slope, stoniness, and depth to bedrock or a cemented pan are the main concerns in developing bivouac areas. For good trafficability, the surface of the bivouac area should absorb rainfall readily, should remain firm under heavy foot traffic, and should not be dusty when dry. Soil properties that influence trafficability are texture of the surface layer, wetness, saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), and large stones. The limitations of low Ksat and a clayey surface layer are not so severe in dry regions of the country as in other regions; however, silty soils may be more of a problem in the dry regions because they are dusty. Soil properties that influence the growth of plants are depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), and the presence of toxic materials. Soils that are subject to flooding are particularly hazardous as bivouac areas because of the danger to life and property.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect bivouac areas. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected. ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation. Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected. ""Very limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for the specified use. The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive installation procedures. Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected.

232,"Catastrophic Mortality, Large Animal Disposal, Pit",cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"""Catastrophic mortality, large animal disposal, pit,"" is a method of disposing of dead animals by placing the carcasses in successive layers in an excavated pit. The carcasses are spread, compacted, and covered daily with a thin layer of soil that is excavated from the pit. When the pit is full, a final cover of soil material at least 2 feet thick is placed over the burial pit.

The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas. While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected. Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or floodwater. The risk of contamination can be reduced or eliminated by installing systems designed to eliminate or reduce the adverse effects of limiting soil properties. Ratings are for soils in their present condition. The present land use is not considered in the ratings.

Ratings are based on properties and qualities to the depth normally observed during soil mapping (approximately 6 or 7 feet). However, because pits may be as deep as 15 feet or more, geologic investigations are needed to determine the potential for pollution of ground water and to determine the design needed. These investigations, which are generally arranged by the pit developer, include examination of stratification, rock formations, and geologic conditions that might lead to the conducting of leachates to aquifers, wells, watercourses, and other water sources. The presence of hard, nonrippable bedrock, bedrock crevices, or highly permeable strata at or directly below the proposed pit bottom is undesirable because of the difficulty in excavation and the potential pollution of underground water.

Properties that influence the risk of pollution, ease of excavation, trafficability, and revegetation are major considerations. Soils that are flooded or have a water table within the depth of excavation present a potential pollution hazard and are difficult to excavate. Slope is an important consideration because it affects the work involved in road construction, the performance of the roads, and the control of surface water around the pit. It may also cause difficulty in constructing pits in which the pit bottom must be kept level and oriented to follow the contour of the land.

The ease with which the pit is dug and with which a soil can be used as daily and final cover is based largely on soil texture and consistence, which determine workability when the soil is dry and when it is wet. Soils that are plastic and sticky when wet are difficult to excavate, grade, or compact and difficult to place as a uniformly thick cover over a layer of carcasses. The uppermost part of the final cover should be soil material that favors the growth of plants. It should not contain excess sodium or salts and should not be too acid. In comparison with other horizons, the surface layer in most soils has the best workability and the highest content of organic matter. Thus, it may be desirable to stockpile the surface layer for use in the final blanketing of the filled pit area.

275,"Rubble and Debris Disposal, Large-Scale Event",cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"Burial of rubble and debris in an expeditiously constructed landfill is a method of disposing of material that has been rendered unsafe and unusable by the effects of a large-scale disaster, either natural or man-made, often affecting tens of counties or parishes.  Many homes and business structures are rendered unfit for occupancy, either by destruction or contamination.  Such a landfill involves excavating a large pit or trench, placing the rubble and debris in the trench, and covering each layer with a blanket of soil material.  A final blanket of cover material is placed over the whole facility when completed.

This interpretation shows the degree and kind of limitations that affect a soil's use for such a landfill. The soil is evaluated from the surface to 79 inches.  An on-site investigation to greater depth will be needed for final site acceptance.  The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect attenuation of suspended, soil solution, and gaseous decomposition products and microorganisms; construction and maintenance of the site; and public health.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or floodwater.

Soils that have high saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) or are shallow to bedrock, ice, a cemented pan, or stones and boulders are limited because these features interfere with the installation, performance, and maintenance of the system.  Slope is an important consideration because it affects the work involved in road construction, the performance of the roads, and the control of surface water around the excavation.  It may also cause difficulty in constructing trenches for which the trench or pit bottom must be kept level and oriented to follow the ground contour.

The ease with which the trench or pit is dug and with which a soil can be used as daily and final covers is based largely on texture and consistence of the soil which affect the workability of the soil both when dry and when wet.  Soils that are plastic and sticky when wet are difficult to excavate, grade, or compact and difficult to place as a uniformly thick cover over a layer of rubble or debris.  The uppermost part of the final cover should be soil material that is favorable for the growth of plants.  It should not contain excess sodium or salt and should not be too acid.  In comparison with other horizons, the A horizon in most soils has the best workability and the highest content of organic matter.  Thus, for a rubble and debris disposal operation it may be desirable to stockpile the surface layer for use in the final blanketing of the filled area. 

The ratings are both verbal and numerical.  Numerical ratings indicate the severity of the individual limitations.  The ratings are shown in decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00.  They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (0.00).

Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect these uses.  ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use.  Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected of a properly designed and installed system on these soils.  ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation.  Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected.  ""Severely limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for the specified use.  The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive installation procedures.  Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected.

2647,Soil Health - Organic Matter,chorizon,om_r,Float,NA,2,"Organic matter percent is the weight of decomposed plant, animal, and microbial residues exclusive of non-decomposed plant and animal residues. It is expressed as a percentage, by weight, of the soil material that is less than 2 mm in diameter.

Significance:
Soil organic matter (SOM) influences the physical, chemical, and biological properties of soils far more than suggested by its relatively small proportion in most soils. The organic fraction influences plant growth through its influence on these soil properties. It encourages soil aggregation, especially macroaggregation, increases porosity, and lowers bulk density. Because the soil structure is improved, water infiltration rates increase. SOM has a high capacity to adsorb and exchange cations and is important to pesticide binding. It furnishes energy to microorganisms in the soil. As SOM is decomposed by soil microbes, it releases nitrogen, phosphorous, sulfur, and many micronutrients, which become available for plant growth. SOM is a heterogeneous, dynamic substance that varies in particle size, carbon content, decomposition rate, and turnover time. In general, the content of SOM is highest at the surface—where plant, animal, and microbial residue inputs are greatest—and decreases with depth. 

Total organic carbon (TOC) is the carbon (C) stored in SOM. Total organic carbon is also referred to as soil organic carbon (SOC) in the scientific literature. Organic carbon enters the soil through the decomposition of plant and animal residues, root exudates, and living and dead microorganisms. Inorganic carbon is common in calcareous soils in the form of calcium and magnesium carbonates. In calcareous soils, the content of inorganic carbon can exceed TOC.

Factors Affecting Content of SOM and SOC:

Inherent factors - Soil texture, parent material, drainage, climate, and time affect accumulation of SOM. Soils that are rich in clay have greater capacity to protect SOM from decomposition by stabilizing substances that bind to clay surfaces. The formation of soil aggregates—enabled by the presence of clay, aluminum and iron oxides, fungal hyphae, bacterial exudates (carbohydrates), and fine roots—protects SOM from microbial decomposition. Extractable aluminum and allophanes, which are present in volcanic soils, can react with SOM to form compounds that are stable and resist microbial decomposition. Warm temperatures increase decomposition rates of SOM. High mean annual precipitation increases accumulation rates of SOM by stimulating the production of plant biomass. 

Loss of SOM through erosion results in SOM variations along slope gradients. Areas of level topography tend to have much more SOM than areas with other slope classes. Both elevation and topographic gradients affect local climate, vegetation distribution, and soil properties. They also affect associated biogeochemical processes, including SOM dynamics. Analysis of factors affecting C in the conterminous United States indicates that the effects of land use, topography (elevation and slope), and mean annual precipitation on SOM are more obvious than the effects of mean annual temperature. However, when other variables are highly restricted, SOM content clearly declines with increasing temperature.

Dynamic factors - Dynamic gains and losses in SOM are due primarily to management decisions in combination with climate and microbial influences. Accumulation of SOM is controlled by the rate of C mineralization, the amount and stage of decomposition of plant residues, and the addition of organic amendments to soil.

Soil organic carbon comprises approximately 52 to 58% of the SOM and is the main source of energy for soil microorganisms. The C within plant residues, particulate organic matter, and soil microbial biomass is generally considered to be within the active pool of SOM. The emergent view of SOM focuses on microbial access to SOM and includes an emphasis on the need to manage C flows rather than discrete C pools. During decomposition of SOM, energy and nutrients are released and utilized by plant roots and soil biota. Recognizing that SOM is a continuum of decomposition products is a first step in designing management strategies for renewing SOM sources throughout the year.

Soil aggregates of various sizes and stabilities can act as sites at which SOM is physically protected from decomposition and C mineralization. Soil disturbance and aggregate destruction increase biodegradation of SOM. Aggregates are readily broken apart by tillage operations.

Crop residues incorporated into or left on the soil surface reduce erosion and the losses of SOM associated with sediment. In acidic soils, applications of lime increase plant productivity, microbial activity, organic matter decomposition, and CO2 release.

The diversity of the soil microbial population affects SOM. For example, while soil bacteria and some fungi participate in SOM loss by mineralizing C compounds, other fungi, such as mycorrhizae, facilitate stabilization and physical protection by aggregating SOM with clay and minerals. SOM is better protected from degradation within aggregates than in free-form. 

Relationship to Soil Function:
SOM is one of the most important soil constituents. It affects plant growth by improving aggregate stability, soil structure, water availability, and nutrient cycling. SOM fractions in the active pool, described above, are the main source of energy and nutrients for soil microorganisms, which mediate nutrient cycling in the soil. Biochemically stable SOM participates in aggregate stability and in holding capacity for nutrients and water.

Microaggregates are formed by mineral interactions with iron and aluminum oxides and are generally considered an inherent soil characteristic. They are, however, impacted by current and past management. Fine roots, fungal hyphae, and organic carbon compounds, such as complex sugars (carbohydrates) and proteins (also referred to as glues), bind mineral particles and microaggregates together to form macroaggregates that are still porous enough to allow air, water, and plant roots to move through the soil.

An increase in SOM leads to greater biological diversity and activity in the soil, thus increasing biological control of plant diseases and pests.

Problems Associated with Low Organic Matter Levels:
Low levels of SOM result in energy-source shortages and thereby lowered levels of microbial biomass, activity, and nutrient mineralization. In noncalcareous soils, aggregate stability, infiltration, drainage, and airflow are also reduced. Scarcity of SOM results in less diversity in soil biota and a risk of disruption to the food chain equilibrium. This disruption can cause disturbance in the soil environment (e.g., increased plant pests and diseases and accumulation of toxic substances).

Improving SOM Levels:
An estimated 4.4x10 to the 9th power tons of C have been lost from soils of the United States due to traditional farming practices. Most of this carbon was SOC. Nearly half of the SOM has been lost from many agricultural soils. Other farming practices, such as no-till and cover cropping (especially when used together), can stop losses of SOM and even lead to increases. Continuous application of manure and compost can increase SOM. Burning, harvesting, or otherwise removing plant residues decreases SOM.

Measurement:
SOM is measured in the laboratory by determining total carbon (TC) content using either dry or wet-dry combustion. Current analytical methods do not distinguish between decomposed and nondecomposed residues, so soil is first sieved to 2 mm to remove as much of the recognizable plant material as possible. If no carbonates are present, TC is considered to be the same as TOC (or SOC). For calcareous soils, soil inorganic carbon in the form carbonates must also be measured and then subtracted from the TC to determine TOC content. Results are given as the percent TOC in dry soil. To convert percent TOC to percent SOM, multiply the TOC percentage by 1.724. To convert percent SOM to percent TOC, divide the SOM percentage by 1.724. Note that this value continues to be debated by researchers with possible values ranging from 1.4 to 2.5 (Pribyl, 2010). A conversion factor of 2 has been suggested for this database but has not yet been adopted. Detailed procedures for measurement of SOM are outlined in 'Soil Survey Investigations Report No. 42, Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory Methods Manual, Version 5.0,' (Soil Survey Staff, 2014).

Many soil testing laboratories use a 'loss on ignition' method to estimate soil organic matter. The estimate produced by this method must be correlated to analytical TOC measurements for each area to improve accuracy. The loss on ignition method can provide a good indication of the trend in SOM content within a field. It is important to note that temperature and timing used for the loss on ignition approach vary across labs and can influence results. Thus, comparisons should be made using only results from within a given lab.

Currently, no standard method exists to measure TOC in the field. Attempts have been made to develop charts that match color to TOC content, but the correlation is better within soil landscapes and only for limited soils. Near-infrared spectroscopy has been tested for measuring C directly in the field, but it is expensive and sensitive to moisture content.

Estimates:
Color and feel are soil characteristics that can be used to estimate SOM content. Color comparisons in areas of similar parent materials and textures can be correlated with laboratory data and thereby enable a soil scientist to make field estimates. In general, darker colors or black indicate the presence of higher amounts of organic matter. The contrast of color between the A horizon and subsurface horizons is also a good indicator. Sandy soils tend to look darker with a lower content of SOM. In general, lower numbers for hue, value, and chroma (in the Munsell soil color system) tend to be associated with darker soil colors that are attributed to higher content of SOM, soil moisture, or both.

For each soil layer, this attribute is actually recorded as three separate values in the database. A low value and a high value indicate the range of this attribute for the soil component. A 'representative' value indicates the expected value of this attribute for the component. For this soil property, only the representative value is used.

2682,Fragile Soil Index,cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"Soils can be rated based on their susceptibility to degradation in the ""Fragile Soil Index"" interpretation.  Fragile soils are those that are most vulnerable to degradation. In other words, they can be easily degraded—they have a low resistance to degradation processes. They tend to be highly susceptible to erosion and can have a low capacity to recover after degradation has occurred (low resilience). Fragile soils are generally characterized by a low content of organic matter, low aggregate stability, and weak soil structure. They are generally located on sloping ground, have sparse plant cover, and tend to be in arid or semiarid regions. The index can be used for conservation and watershed planning to assist in identifying soils and areas highly vulnerable to degradation.

Depending on inherent soil characteristics and the climate, soils can vary from highly resistant, or stable, to vulnerable and extremely sensitive to degradation. Under stress, fragile soils can degrade to a new altered state, which may be less favorable or unfavorable for plant growth and less capable of performing soil functions. To assess the fragility of the soil, indicators of vulnerability to degradation processes are used. They include organic matter, soil structure, rooting depth, vegetative cover, slope, and aridity. 

The organic matter content indicates the capacity of the soil to resist and/or recover from degradation processes. Organic matter improves the soil pore structure, increases water infiltration, and reduces soil compaction and soil erosion. Soil structure indicates the capacity of the soil to resist degradation from accelerated water erosion (by increasing the amount of infiltration). Pore structure is the most important aspect of soil structure as pores provide habitat for organism. Shallow soils are more vulnerable to degradation processes because they have limited rooting depth and have a reduced amount of material from which to form new soil. As erosion removes the upper soil profile, productivity will decline if the subsoil is limiting for crop growth. Vegetative cover is very important as uncovered soil is most vulnerable to the processes of soil erosion, both by wind and water. Slope (a measure of the steepness or the degree of inclination) indicates the degree of vulnerability to erosion and mass movement. Aridity is defined by the shortage of moisture. Lack of water is a main factor limiting biological processes and the ability of the soil to resist and/or recover from degradation.

Soils are placed into interpretive classes based on their index rating, which ranges from 0 to 1. An index rating of 1 is the most fragile, while a rating of zero is the least fragile. Interpretative classes are as follows:

Not Fragile (index rating less than or equal to 0.009) – These soils have a very high potential to resist degradation and be highly resilient. They are highly structured with an organic matter content greater than 5.7%, are nearly level, are deep or very deep, have greater than 85% vegetative cover, and are in a climate that is wet or very wet.

Slightly Fragile (index rating less than 0.009 and less than or equal to 0.209) – These soils have a high potential to resist degradation and be resilient. They are:
-- Poorly structured to weakly structured soils that have an extremely low to moderate content of organic matter, are very deep, have high vegetative cover, occur on nearly level ground, and are in wet or very wet climates;
-- Highly structured soils that have a very high content of organic matter, are very shallow to moderately deep, have high vegetative cover, occur on nearly level ground, and are in wet or very wet climates;
-- Highly structured soils that have a very high content of organic matter, are very deep, have low to moderately high vegetative cover, occur on nearly level ground, and are in wet or very wet climates;
-- Highly structured soils that have a very high content of organic matter, are very deep, have high vegetative cover; are on slopes greater than 3%, and are in wet or very wet climates; or
-- Highly structured soils that have a very high content of organic matter, are very deep, have high vegetative cover; occur on nearly level ground, and in semi-dry to mildly wet climates; 

Moderately Fragile (index rating greater than 0.209 and less than or equal to 0.409) – These soils have a moderate potential to resist degradation and be moderately resilient. They are:

-- Poorly structured soils that have an extremely low content of organic matter, are deep, have low vegetative cover, occur in nearly level areas, and are in wet or very wet climates; 
-- Poorly structured soils that have an extremely low content of organic matter, occur on gentle to very steep slopes, have high vegetative cover, and are in wet or very wet climates; 
-- Weakly structured soils that have a very low content of organic matter, are deep, occur in nearly level to gently sloping areas, have high vegetative cover, and are in semi-dry climates; or 
-- Weakly structured soils that have a very low content of organic matter, are very shallow to very deep, occur in nearly level to strongly sloping areas, have high vegetative cover, and are in mildly wet climates.

Fragile (index rating greater than 0.409 and less than or equal to 0.609) – These soils have a low potential to resist degradation and low resilience. They are:
-- Well structured soils that have a low content of organic matter, are shallow to very deep, have moderate to moderately high vegetative cover, occur on steep slopes, and are in dry climates; 
-- Well structured soils that have a low content of organic matter, are shallow to very deep, have a low vegetative cover, occur in nearly level to gently sloping areas, and are in dry climates;

-- Weakly structured soils that have a low content of organic matter, occur on moderately steep to very steep slopes, have low vegetative cover, and are in wet or very wet climates.

Very Fragile (index rating greater than 0.609 and less than or equal to 0.809) – These soils have a very low potential to resist degradation and very low resilience. They are:
-- Weakly structured soils that have an extremely low content of organic matter, are deep, have low vegetative cover, occur on nearly level to very steep slopes, and are in dry climates;

-- Poorly structured soils that have an extremely low content of organic matter, are very shallow, have no vegetative cover, occur on steep slopes, and are in mildly wet to wet climates.

Extremely Fragile (index rating greater than 0.809 and less than or equal to 1.0) – These soils can have no potential to resist degradation and no resilience. They are:
-- Poorly structured soils that have an extremely low content of organic matter, are very shallow, have low vegetative cover, occur on very steep slopes, and are in dry or very dry climates; 
-- Weakly structured soils that have a very low content of organic matter, are nearly level to very deep, have low vegetative cover, occur on very steep slopes, and are in dry climates; or
-- Very shallow soils on steep slopes.

2694,Soil Susceptibility to Compaction,cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"Soils are rated based on their susceptibility to compaction from the operation of ground-based equipment for planting, harvesting, and site preparation activities when soils are moist.  Soil compaction is the process in which soil particles are pressed together more closely that in the original state.  Typically, the soil must be moist to be compacted because the mineral grains must slide together.  Compaction reduces the abundance mostly of large pores in the soil by damaging the structure of the soil.  This produces several effects that are unwanted in agricultural soils since large pores are most effective at transmitting water and air through the soil.  Compaction also increases the soil strength which can limit root penetration and growth.  The ability of soil to hold water is adversely affected by compaction since the large pores hold water.  The degree of compaction of a soil is measured by its bulk density, which is the mass per unit volume, generally expressed in grams per cubic centimeter.

Compacted soils are less favorable for good plant growth because of high soil bulk density and hardness, reduced pore space, and poor aeration and drainage. Root penetration and growth is decreased in compacted soils because the hardness or strength of these soils prevents the expansion of roots. Supplies of air, water, and nutrients that roots need are also less favorable when compaction decreases soil porosity and drainage.

Interpretation ratings are based on soil properties in the upper 12 inches of the profile.  Factors considered are soil texture, soil organic matter content, soil structure, rock fragment content, and the existing bulk density.  Each of these is thought to contribute to resisting the susceptibility of a soil to compaction when present.  Organic matter in the soil provides resistance to compaction and the resilience to ameliorate the effects with time.  Soil structure adds strength as discrete aggregates and it is the aggregates that are deformed or destroyed by compactive forces, thus strong soil structure lowers the susceptibility to compaction.  Similarly, rock fragments in the soil can bridge and provide a framework to resist compaction.  Finally, if a soil is already fairly dense causing further compaction is more difficult. 

Definitions of the ratings:

Low - The potential for compaction is insignificant.  This soil is able to support standard equipment with minimal compaction. The soil is moisture insensitive, exhibiting only small changes in density with changing moisture content.

Medium - The potential for compaction is significant.  The growth rate of seedlings may be reduced following compaction.  After the initial compaction (i.e., the first equipment pass), this soil is able to support standard equipment with only minimal increases in soil density.  The soil is intermediate between moisture insensitive and moisture sensitive.

High - The potential for compaction is significant.  The growth rate of seedlings will be reduced following compaction.  After initial compaction, this soil is still able to support standard equipment, but will continue to compact with each subsequent pass.  The soil is moisture sensitive, exhibiting large changes in density with changing moisture content.

The map unit components listed for each map unit in the accompanying Summary by Map Unit table in Web Soil Survey or the Aggregation Report in Soil Data Viewer are determined by the aggregation method chosen.

2712,Farm and Garden Composting Facility - Surface,cointerp,interphrc,String,254,NA,"Composting is a method of using natural processes to change vegetative debris into a useful product. This interpretation evaluates the degree and kind of limitation(s) that affect the siting of a surface composting facility to stabilize vegetative debris produced as a result of typical farming and horticultural practices. 

The soil is evaluated from the surface to a depth of 79 inches. The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect trafficability; attenuation of suspended, soil solution, and gaseous decomposition products and microorganisms; construction and maintenance of the site; and public health. Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or floodwater. 

Properties that influence the risk of pollution, ease of excavation, trafficability, and revegetation are major considerations. Soils that flood or have a water table within the depth of excavation present a potential pollution hazard and are difficult to excavate. Soils that have high saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), that are shallow to bedrock, ice, or a cemented pan, or that have a high content of stones and boulders are limited because these features interfere with the installation, performance, and maintenance of the system. Slope is an important consideration because it affects the work involved in road construction, the performance of the roads, and the control of surface water around the facility.

Climatic factors influence the ease with which a composting facility can be maintained. Adequate precipitation to keep the mass moist, and sufficient heat to sustain biological activity are essential. 

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Numerical ratings indicate the severity of the individual limitations. The ratings are shown in decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest limitation on the use (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (0.00). 

Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect these uses. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected of a properly designed and installed system on these soils. ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation. Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected. ""Very limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for the specified use. The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive installation procedures. Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected.
