Vona, is a coarse-loamy, mixed, mesic Aridic Haplustalf and Olnest, fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haplustalf were used as minor components for this DMU
and MU.  Fine textured soils were excluded as minor components, we felt that if fine textured soils consistantly showed up MLRA wide this unit should be a 
complex and not a consociaton.  Vona was chosen because of parent material, landform and argillic.  These landforms have been stable long enough for the 
development of an argillic horizon.  Two fine-loamy Ustic Haplustalfs, Olnest and Stoneham were prevealent throughout the MLRA and were minor components 
in several map units.  Olnest was chosen for landform and parent material.  This map unit and components are formed in a plains setting with eolian and alluvial
material as it's parent material.  From our experiance Stoneham soil is also influenced by slope alluvium and pedisediment with corresponding higher clay and
more pronounced structual development and is also found on hill and pediment landforms.
