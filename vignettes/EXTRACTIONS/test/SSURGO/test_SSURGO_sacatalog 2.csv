The information was prepared by digitizing maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base and digitizing, or by revising digitized maps using remotely sensed and other information. This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute data. The map data are in a 7.5 minute quadrangle format and include a detailed, field verified inventory of soils and nonsoil areas that normally occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped. A special soil features layer (point and line features) is optional. This layer displays the location of features too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil Information System relational database, which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.</abstract><purpose>SSURGO depicts information about the kinds and distribution of soils on the landscape.

Some of these requirements include: chains must begin and end at nodes, chains must connect to each other at nodes, chains do not extend through nodes, left and right GT-polygons are defined for each chain element and are consistent throughout, and the chains representing the limits of the file (neatline) are free of gaps. The tests of logical consistency are performed using vendor software. The neatline is generated by connecting the explicitly entered four corners of the digital file. All data outside the enclosed region are ignored and all data crossing these geographically straight lines are clipped at the neatline. Data within a specified tolerance of the neatline are snapped to the neatline. Neatline straightening aligns the digitized edges of the digital data with the generated neatline (i.e., with the longitude/latitude lines in geographic coordinates). All internal polygons are tested for closure with vendor software and are checked on hard copy plots. All data are checked for common soil lines (i.e., adjacent polygons with the same label). Quadrangles are edge matched within the soil survey area and edge locations generally do not deviate from centerline to centerline by more than 0.01 inch. The extent of the soil survey boundary is edge matched to adjacent certified soil survey boundaries of Golden County Area, Colorado, Parts of Denver, Douglas, Jefferson, and Park Counties, and Larimer County Area, Colorado. However, feature labels and soil lines in this survey are not matched to those of adjacent surveys.</logic><complete>A map unit is a collection of areas defined and named the same in terms of their soil and/or nonsoil areas. Each map unit differs in some respect from all others in a survey area and is uniquely identified. Each individual area is a delineation. Each map unit consists of one or more components. Soil scientists identify small areas of soils or miscellaneous (nonsoil) areas that have properties and behavior significantly different than the named soils in the surrounding map unit. These minor components may be indicated as special features. If they have a minimal effect on use and management, or could not be precisely located, they may not be indicated on the map. Specific National Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures were used in the classification of soils, design and name of map units, and location of special soil features. These standards are outlined in Agricultural Handbook 18, Soil Survey Manual, 1993, USDA, SCS; Agricultural Handbook 436, Soil Taxonomy, Soil Survey Staff, 1975, USDA, SCS; and all Amendments; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Soil Survey Staff, (current issue); National Soil Survey Handbook, title 430-VI, (current issue). The actual composition and interpretive purity of the map unit delineations were based on data collected by scientists during the course of preparing the soil maps. Adherence to National Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures is based on peer review, quality control, and quality assurance. Quality control is outlined in the memorandum of understanding for the soil survey area and in documents that reside with the Natural Resources Conservation Service state soil scientist. Four kinds of map units are used in soil surveys: consociations, complexes, associations, and undifferentiated groups. Consociations - Consociations are named for the dominant soil. In a consociation, delineated areas are dominated by a single soil taxon and similar soils. At least one half of the pedons in each delineation are of the same soil component so similar to the named soil that major interpretations are not affected significantly. The total amount of dissimilar inclusions of other components in a map unit generally does not exceed about 15 percent if limiting and 25 percent if nonlimiting. A single component of a dissimilar limiting inclusion generally does not exceed 10 percent if very contrasting. Complexes and associations - Complexes and associations are named for two or more dissimilar components with the dominant component listed first. They occur in a regularly repeating pattern. The major components of a complex cannot be mapped separately at a scale of about 1:24,000. The major components of an association can be separated at a scale of about 1:24,000. In each delineation of either a complex or an association, each major component is normally present, though their proportions may vary appreciably from one delineation to another. The total amount of inclusions in a map unit that are dissimilar to any of the major components does not exceed 15 percent if limiting and 25 percent if nonlimiting. A single kind of dissimilar limiting inclusion usually does not exceed 10 percent. Undifferentiated Groups - Undifferentiated groups consist of two or more components that do not always occur together in the same delineation, but are included in the same named map unit because use and management are the same or similar for common uses. Every delineation has at least one of the major components and some may have all of them. The same principles regarding proportion of inclusions apply to undifferentiated groups as to consociations. Minimum documentation consists of three or more complete soil profile descriptions for each series added to the legend. In addition, transects were recorded as needed to support correlation decisions. The number of steps in each transect were dependent on the size of the particular map unit and the soil properties observed. A defined standard or level of confidence in the interpretive purity of the map unit delineations is attained by adjusting the kind and intensity of field investigations. Field investigations and data collection are carried out in sufficient detail to name map units and to identify accurately and consistently areas of about 5 acres.</complete><posacc><horizpa><horizpar>The accuracy of these digital data is based upon their compilation to base maps that meet National Map Accuracy Standards. The difference in positional accuracy between the soil boundaries and special soil features locations in the field and their digitized map locations is unknown. The locational accuracy of soil delineations on the ground varies with the transition between map units. For example, on long gently sloping landscapes the transition occurs gradually over many feet. Where landscapes change abruptly from steep to level, the transition will be very narrow. Soil delineation boundaries and special soil features generally were digitized within 0.01 inch of their locations on the digitizing source. The digital map elements are edge matched between data sets. The data along each quadrangle edge are matched against the data for the adjacent quadrangle. Edge locations generally do not deviate from centerline to centerline by more than 0.01 inch.</horizpar><qhorizpa><horizpav>0.01</horizpav><horizpae>unknown</horizpae></qhorizpa></horizpa></posacc><lineage><srcinfo><srccite><citeinfo><origin>U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural

All National Interpretations, Department of Homeland Security, and Military Interpretations were included in the export.All obsolete stored interpretations, with the exception of Hydric, in the Component Interpretations table were deleted. Slope shape and slope aspect were determined from DEMs utilizing ArcGIS tools. Where multiple slope shapesand slope aspects were determined for a map unit, thepredominant slope shape, or slope aspect, was entered as the RVfor all components in the map unit. Values for Albedo were populated for components where a taxonomic unit description was available. For many higher taxons (boralfs, cryoboralfs) in the older surveys a representative profile description was not available to assign Albedo. Albedo was left blank for these components.</procdesc><srcused>NASIS</srcused><procdate>20061218</procdate></procstep><procstep><procdesc>The Natural Resources Conservation Service State Soil Scientist or delegate verified that the labels on the digitized soil map units link to map units in the tabular database, and certified the joined data sets for release to the Soil Data Warehouse.

The map unit symbol uniquely identifies each closed delineation map unit. Each symbol is linked to a map unit name. The map unit symbol is also the key for linking information in the National Soil Information System tables. The map unit symbols are not carried within the modified Digital Line Graph file; however, they are made available in a companion attribute file. The attribute file links the minor codes in the Digital Line Graph files to the map unit symbols. Map Unit Delineations are described by the National Soil Information System database. This attribute database gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and the properties for each soil. The database contains both estimated and measured data on the physical and chemical soil properties and soil interpretations for engineering, water management, recreation, agronomic, woodland, range, and wildlife uses of the soil. The National Soil Information System database contains static metadata. It documents the data structure and includes such information as what tables, columns, indexes, and relationships are defined as well as a variety of attributes of each of these database objects. Attributes include table and column descriptions and detailed domain information. The National Soil Information System database also contains a distribution metadata. It records the criteria used for selecting map units and components for inclusion in the set of distributed data. Special features are described in the feature table. It includes a feature label, feature name, and feature description for each special and ad hoc feature in the survey area.</eaover><eadetcit>U.S. Department of Agriculture. 1999.
