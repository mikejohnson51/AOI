7,Recreational Development,"Recreational Development interpretations are tools designed to guide the user in identifying and evaluating the suitability of the soil for specific recreational uses.

Example interpretations include camp areas, picnic areas, playgrounds, paths and trails, and off-road motorcycle trails.",4,NA,08/04/2006 08:54:09
8,Sanitary Facilities,"Sanitary Facilities interpretations are tools designed to guide the user in site selection for the safe disposal of sewage and solid waste.

Example interpretations include septic tank absorption fields, sewage lagoons, and sanitary landfills.",5,NA,08/17/2012 11:06:13
9,Soil Chemical Properties,"Soil Chemical Properties are measured or inferred from direct observations in the field or laboratory.

Examples of soil chemical properties include pH, cation exchange capacity, calcium carbonate, gypsum, and electrical conductivity.",13,NA,08/04/2006 08:53:41
10,Soil Erosion Factors,"Soil Erosion Factors are soil properties and interpretations used in evaluating the soil for potential erosion.

Example soil erosion factors can include K factor for the whole soil or on a rock free basis, T factor, wind erodibility group and wind erodibility index.",11,NA,08/04/2006 08:53:27
11,Soil Health,"Soil health interpretations are designed to be used as tools for evaluating and managing a soil's capacity to function as a vital living ecosystem that sustains plants, animals, and humans.

Example interpretations include compaction, surface sealing, carbon sequestration, resistance and resilience, management systems and practices, and cover crops.",22,NA,08/18/2017 16:47:22
12,Soil Health Properties,"Soil health is defined as the continued capacity of soil to function as a vital living ecosystem that sustains plants, animals, and humans. This folder contains information on soil properties that are important indicators of soil health.",21,NA,08/17/2017 15:26:22
13,Soil Physical Properties,"Soil Physical Properties are measured or inferred from direct observations in the field or laboratory.

Examples of soil physical properties include percent clay, organic matter, saturated hydraulic conductivity, available water capacity, and bulk density.",12,NA,08/04/2006 08:53:11
14,Soil Qualities and Features,"Soil qualities are behavior and performance attributes that are not directly measured, but are inferred from observations of dynamic conditions and from soil properties.  Example soil qualities include natural drainage, and frost action.

Soil features are attributes that are not directly part of the soil.  Example soil features include slope and depth to restrictive layer.  These features can greatly impact the use and management of the soil.",14,NA,08/04/2006 08:52:56
15,Subaqueous Soils,"Subaqueous Soils interpretations are designed to be used as tools for evaluating and managing the capacity of under water soils to function as a vital living ecosystem that sustains plants, animals, and humans.

Example interpretations include Deadweight Anchors, Hard Clam Substrate, Land Utilization of Dredged Materials, Mushroom Anchors, and Eelgrass Restoration.",23,NA,08/23/2017 15:53:33
16,Vegetative Productivity,"Vegetative productivity includes estimates of potential vegetative production for a variety of land uses, including cropland, forestland, hayland, pastureland, horticulture and rangeland.  In the underlying database, some states maintain crop yield data by individual map unit component.  Other states maintain the data at the map unit level.  Attributes are included for both, although only one or the other is likely to contain data for any given geographic area.  For other land uses, productivity data is shown only at the map unit component level.

Examples include potential crop yields under irrigated and nonirrigated conditions, forest productivity, forest site index, and total rangeland production under of normal, favorable and unfavorable conditions.",1,NA,10/25/2006 06:10:47
