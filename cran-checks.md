This is the first submission of this package, and my first overall to CRAN

## Test environments
* local MAC OS X install, R 3.5.1
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.5.0
* win-builder ("R-release", "R-devel")

## R CMD check results
*There were no ERRORs WARNINGs or NOTEs on local MAC OS X and travis.

*One NOTE on build_win()

*checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
           Maintainer: 'Mike Johnson <jmj00@ucsb.edu>'
           
This appears to be due to first submission and there is nothing I can do to remove it.
