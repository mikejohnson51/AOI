Description: An area of interest (AOI) is a geographic extent. 
    AOIs help confine and formalize a unit of work to a geographic area and define research and sub setting efforts while improving reproducibility. 
    They are built around concrete spatial attributes but often are discussed in a more colloquial way.  
    This package lets users define regions through a common query to achieve spatial geometries. 
    Tools are provided to help define, describe, and convert points, boundaries, and features to usable forms including strings and political boundaries (for USA states and counties). 
    In addition, this package provides geocoding and reverse geocoding functions through the Google Maps, OpenStreetMaps and ESRI Webservices. 
    This package is provided to support the bredth of spatial packages in the R ecosystem.
