The purpose of AOI is to help people create reproducible, programmatic, boundaries for analysis and mapping workflows. The package targets five main use cases:

### 1. Basic forward (place name to lat/long) and reverse (lat/long to place name) geocoding tasks

#### > Foward (from name/description to location)

```{r}
geocode('UCSB', pt = TRUE) %>% aoi_map(returnMap = TRUE)
geocode(event = 'I have a dream speech', pt = T) %>% aoi_map(returnMap = TRUE)
```

#### > Reverse (from location to name/description)

```{r}
geocode_rev(c(37,-119))
```

### 2. Consistent query calls for world (rnatural earth) and USA (USAboundaries) boundaries:

#### > Working with USA state and county information:

```{r}
aoi_get(state = "CA") %>% aoi_map(returnMap = T)
aoi_get(state = "TX", county = "Harris") %>% aoi_map(returnMap = T)
```

#### > Working with world boundary data to call country and regional information:

```{r}
aoi_get(country = "Sri Lanka") %>% aoi_map(returnMap = T)

aoi_get(country = "South Asia") %>% aoi_map(returnMap = T)
```


### 3. Creating flexible AOIs from place names and bounding box dimensions. 

#### > Create your own bounding areas from a list of inputs:

```{r}
# 100 square mile region around UCSB
aoi_get(list("UCSB", 10, 10)) %>% aoi_map(returnMap = T)

# 200 square mile region around 37,-119
aoi_get(list(37,-119, 20, 10)) %>% aoi_map(returnMap = T)

```

### 4. Offer a programmatic way to interface with large web-based datasets (e.g TREDDS/OPeNDAP)

See [climateR](https://github.com/mikejohnson51/climateR) for example

### 5. Facilitate iterative analysis in an era of big geospatial data 

### 6. Enhance reproducible in spatial analysis.

The package also includes functions to faciliate basic tasks in AOI work flows such as unioning, buffering, and converting between numeric and spatial representations. The package builds on the sf package and in cases of overlap, only offers wrappers for common workflows. By  nature these wrappers save users lines of code and repetition but are less flexible then there base sf functions. 

### Installation:

```{r, eval = FALSE }
remotes::install_github("mikejohnson51/AOI")
```

### Contributing:

Thank you for considering a contribution!

1) Contributions should be thoroughly tested with [testthat](https://testthat.r-lib.org/).  
2) Code style should attempt to follow the [tidyverse style guide.](http://style.tidyverse.org/)  
3) Please attempt to describe what you want to do prior to contributing by submitting an issue.  
4) Please follow the typical github [fork - pull-request workflow.](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962)  
5) Make sure you use roxygen and run Check before contributing.

Other notes:
- consider running `lintr` prior to contributing.
- consider running `goodpractice::gp()` on the package before contributing.
- consider running `devtools::spell_check()` if you wrote documentation.

### Support:

The "AOI" R package is  supported with funds from the [UCAR COMET program][15]; the [NOAA National Water Center][16]; and the NSF Convergence Accelerator Project.
